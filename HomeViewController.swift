Use the right ratio of water. Add 2 parts water and 1 part rice to a large pot. For slightly firmer rice, use 1 part liquid to 2/3 parts rice. Bring the water to a boil. Once it's boiling, add a big pinch of salt. Maintain a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a tight fitting lid, and maintain a gentle simmer. Cook without peeking or stirring. Cook until the water is absorbed, about 18 minutes. Don't let the steam escape. Whatever you do, don't mix the rice while it's cooking — this will lead to gummy rice. Let the rice rest covered. Turn off the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 10 minutes. During this time, the rice will steam for extra fluffy results. Fluff the rice with a fork.", "Fill a large pot with six quarts water. Bring to a boil. Add salt. Be generous, this salt seasons the pasta as it cooks and penetrates into the noodles. Add the dried pasta. Stir until the water returns to a boil. Set a timer for one minute less than the package instructions recommend. Test for doneness at this point. If you like your pasta very firm (al dente) or are going to be simmering for a while in sauce, check and remove even sooner. Now, strain and cool briefly, but do not rinse. Rinsing washing away the starch that helps the sauce stick to the pasta. Toss in olive oil instead. When ready to use, add to warm sauce, toss and finish cooking or chill for later use."], with: ["https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1281058500/photo/cooking-for-internet-vlogg.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=Qjn8hXQZdTvJvK5TVUBc0C1OFNuTJZZ0eki1btHy3aM=", "https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1281058500/photo/cooking-for-internet-vlogg.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=Qjn8hXQZdTvJvK5TVUBc0C1OFNuTJZZ0eki1btHy3aM=", "https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1281058500/photo/cooking-for-internet-vlogg.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=Qjn8hXQZdTvJvK5TVUBc0C1OFNuTJZZ0eki1btHy3aM=", "https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1281058500/photo/cooking-for-internet-vlogg.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=Qjn8hXQZdTvJvK5TVUBc0C1OFNuTJZZ0eki1btHy3aM=", "https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1281058500/photo/cooking-for-internet-vlogg.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=Qjn8hXQZdTvJvK5TVUBc0C1OFNuTJZZ0eki1btHy3aM=", "https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1281058500/photo/cooking-for-internet-vlogg.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=Qjn8hXQZdTvJvK5TVUBc0C1OFNuTJZZ0eki1btHy3aM="])

Guidelines for the FDA’s Acceptable Daily Intake levels (ADIs) are based on 35-to 70-year old studies; if newer research were used to revise those levels, they would be much lower, write the authors of the report.

There are some beverages, such as the Keurig Dr. Pepper’s soda, Sundrop, and generic lemon-lime drinks, that still contain BVO. BVO is associated with potential health risks, including harm to the nervous system. One early study found that rats that consumed large quantities of BVO showed significant reproductive harm. The FDA’s position on BVO is that it can be used safely “on an interim basis” provided that drinks contained less than 15 parts per million in the finished beverage; the average drink that contains BVO contains about half that amount.",

A previous study found that BHA caused cancer in the forestomach of rats and concluded that the additive should be classified in the category of “sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity” according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) criteria. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stated that BHA is “reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen” in a 2011 report. CSPI recommends people avoid consuming BHA. BHT is the chemical cousin to BHA and the two compounds are often used together, according to the Environmental Working Group (EWG), a nonprofit that works to protect public health. It’s not listed as a carcinogen, but there have been studies where rats fed BHT have developed cancer, and it has been shown to cause developmental effects and thyroid changes in animals, according to a safety report on BHA.", "This additive is typically found in bread and packaged baked good products, says McBride. According to CSPI, the two potentially risky chemicals form when azodicarbonamide is baked. One of those, semicarbazide, doesn’t appear to pose a risk to humans, but the second breakdown product, urethane, is a recognized carcinogen. Although the risk is small, CSPI claims azodicarbonamide isn’t necessary for the food supply and should be banned in the United States, and they recommend avoiding it.", "This additive is used in white flour, bread, and rolls to increase the volume of the bread and give it a fine crumb (not crusty) structure. Most bromate rapidly breaks down to form bromide, which is harmless. However, bromate has been shown to cause cancer in animals, and trace amounts of the chemical may remain in bread which could potentially be a small health risk to consumers, says McBride.Bromate has been banned in most countries around the world except for Japan and the United States. In 1999, CSPI petitioned the FDA to ban bromate, and it recommends consumers avoid this additive. Many millers and bakers have stopped using bromate, and it’s rarely used in California because a cancer warning may have to be included on the label, according to the organization.", "This additive is used for coloring and is found in Skittles, Starburst, baked goods, soups, broths, sauces, and sandwich spreads. “Titanium dioxide is something that can build up over time — it doesn’t get excreted very well,” says Sathyanarayana. The additive has been shown to be genotoxic in studies, which is why it is banned in Europe, she explains. Genotoxicity refers to the ability of a chemical substance to damage DNA, which is the genetic material in all cells, and it may lead to carcinogenic, or cancerous, effects.", "The current regulatory system in the United States leaves much of the work of figuring out what’s safe or unsafe to the consumer, says Sathyanarayana. Consume fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables whenever possible. Try to focus on consuming fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables and move away from eating processed foods. People are working a lot, and we don’t have time to make everything from scratch. You can make a lot of good food from frozen ingredients where you don’t have to do all the washing and chopping that some fresh vegetables require. Read product labels. Foods that are labeled “organic” can help take some of the guesswork out. In packaged foods, those given an organic designation are prohibited from using ingredients that “have an adverse effect on human health,” according to the EWG. Consumer advocacy groups such as CSPI and EWG provide lists of additives you should reduce or avoid. There also apps: Sift Food Labels and Ingredio, which use pictures of food ingredients on the label or a bar code and alert you of any potentially risky additives."], with: ["https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2A8G646/no-preservative-icon-on-white-background-no-preservative-sign-flat-style-no-chemicals-experiment-sign-for-your-web-site-design-logo-app-ui-no-2A8G646.jpg", "https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2A8G646/no-preservative-icon-on-white-background-no-preservative-sign-flat-style-no-chemicals-experiment-sign-for-your-web-site-design-logo-app-ui-no-2A8G646.jpg", "https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2A8G646/no-preservative-icon-on-white-background-no-preservative-sign-flat-style-no-chemicals-experiment-sign-for-your-web-site-design-logo-app-ui-no-2A8G646.jpg", "https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2A8G646/no-preservative-icon-on-white-background-no-preservative-sign-flat-style-no-chemicals-experiment-sign-for-your-web-site-design-logo-app-ui-no-2A8G646.jpg", "https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2A8G646/no-preservative-icon-on-white-background-no-preservative-sign-flat-style-no-chemicals-experiment-sign-for-your-web-site-design-logo-app-ui-no-2A8G646.jpg", "https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2A8G646/no-preservative-icon-on-white-background-no-preservative-sign-flat-style-no-chemicals-experiment-sign-for-your-web-site-design-logo-app-ui-no-2A8G646.jpg", "https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2A8G646/no-preservative-icon-on-white-background-no-preservative-sign-flat-style-no-chemicals-experiment-sign-for-your-web-site-design-logo-app-ui-no-2A8G646.jpg", "https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2A8G646/no-preservative-icon-on-white-background-no-preservative-sign-flat-style-no-chemicals-experiment-sign-for-your-web-site-design-logo-app-ui-no-2A8G646.jpg"])

But this one’s for you especially if you’re a student, working woman or a busy housewife who just doesn’t have the time to take care of herself and exercise either. This small change in your diet will go a long way. When you’re healthier, fitter, and have better clearer skin, you’ll automatically be more confident about your looks and your body. It can be very hard making these changes in your diet, nobody ever said it was easy. And as much as you love going home and having pizza, Chinese, or an extremely cheesy pasta every night, you must start to love yourself. And you do this by giving your body what it needs. Get rid of junk food and switch to healthy alternatives. But keep in mind that this does not mean you give up food altogether and stop eating. There are many ways to switch to a healthier lifestyle: some of them include meal prep, healthier alternatives, eating a lot but in short proportions and more constantly.",

Water is one of the best beverages you can have for rehydration, and it’s free! The intensity of your workout will depend on how much water your body loses. How much you sweat affects it as well. But why does water matter? Let’s take a closer look. Most of our body is made up of water. It’s not a surprise that you require a lot of it—and even more when you work out. Many people show to the gym already dehydrated, then workout and become even more dehydrated. This can cause quite a bit of negative effects. Your workout can become harder, you could suffer performance issues, and take a longer time to recover after it. Just 2% of water weight loss can cause this. Some people lose about 6 to 10% from a single workout. It’s recommended to drink at least ½ to 1 oz of water per pound of bodyweight a day. To combat water loss, some experts also recommend weighing before and after your workout.",

There are dozens of exercises you can do like yoga, Pilates, HIIT, weightlifting, cardio, you get the idea. Even variants of the exercises you do help with your muscle gains.

Not only do stretches have benefits for your workout, but dynamic warmups do too. A study from Austin State University found that people who warmed up lightly with leg extensions and squats were able to put more power into their squats. On average, they were able to squat with 8.36% more weight than when they just did typical stretches. They also had increased stability with 22.7% lower body stability.

While it might work great for the short term, it’s not beneficial in the long run. Your routine does need to include some type of lifting program. Why?

A lack of sleep hinders your performance, your caloric burn, and makes it harder for you to do better in your next session. Why? Sleep helps your muscles and body recover from sessions, so not sleeping much can cause overtraining symptoms or plateaus.[15] While sleep doesn’t come easy for everyone, it’s recommended to get at least seven to nine hours each night.",

While this is true in theory (calories in vs calories out), it’s not exactly healthy. When you work out hard, your body needs time and adequate nutrients to recover properly. Protein helps rebuild muscles and is one of those essential food items you want to make sure you’re eating enough of. A study from the Netherlands showed that consuming food rich in casein before bed keeps your amino acid and protein synthesis going while you’re asleep.[16] Now, that’s not to say go crazy before bed, but a light snack of Greek yogurt or a cup of cottage cheese will help.",

Regardless if you’re doing high-intensity or low-impact, you’ll still receive the benefits. However, it often gets a bad reputation and many actually skip cardio. But cardio itself isn’t bad to add to your routine if you’re a guy or someone who typically skips it. Why? Because it enhances muscle building.  If you’ve ever done cardio then tried lifting, you know it doesn’t end well. By the time you try to lift, your whole body has given up. However, if you want to get the benefits of cardio, squeeze it in after your lift session. You’ll have more energy, and you’ll burn more fat too. A study from the Journal of Sports Science Medicine found that those who did high-intensity cardio sessions lasting longer than 30 minutes when into muscle hypertrophy. Those that performed low-impact exercises benefitted the most with more muscle growth over time.[17] It’s recommended that if you perform high-intensity workouts, to wait at least three hours before taking on a long cardio session. https://www.lifehack.org/893083/workout-tips"], with: ["https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fit-woman-doing-yoga-plank-260nw-1591188538.jpg", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fit-woman-doing-yoga-plank-260nw-1591188538.jpg", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fit-woman-doing-yoga-plank-260nw-1591188538.jpg", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fit-woman-doing-yoga-plank-260nw-1591188538.jpg", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fit-woman-doing-yoga-plank-260nw-1591188538.jpg", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fit-woman-doing-yoga-plank-260nw-1591188538.jpg", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fit-woman-doing-yoga-plank-260nw-1591188538.jpg", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fit-woman-doing-yoga-plank-260nw-1591188538.jpg", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/fit-woman-doing-yoga-plank-260nw-1591188538.jpg",

Loving yourself is valued by modern society if it helps you to get ahead. Constant self-improvement is what matters in a performance-focused society that positions people as objects of enhancement and optimization. Neoliberalism assumes women's lives are shaped by deliberate choices for which they, as individuals, are responsible. Little attention is paid to the contexts that constrain women's choices.

Modern dating advice often implies women can and should fix themselves, and their relationships.

Rather than upskilling women to deal with the harm they risk in dating men, the self-help industry should focus on male behavior—not the reactions of women to this behavior. Women need safety more than they need advice. The most important dating advice the self-help industry can offer is for a male audience: do not harm the women around you. Mateship is revered in Australia, yet male friendships are often devoid of vulnerability, openness, intimacy, and self-disclosure. This likely has to do with toxic expectations around masculinity that may manifest in emotional suppression and masking of distress, misogyny and homophobia. Research has found male attitudes towards masculinity, feminism, and homophobia are predictive of date-rape-supportive attitudes and self-reported histories of sexual coercion. Rather than teaching women how to respond to dangerous dating behaviors, the self-help industry should examine what men are taught about dating and relationships. The self-help industry could play an important role in educating online dating app users about how to avoid perpetrating harassment, discrimination, and sexual violence.

By contrast, a low relationship-effectiveness score denotes negative relationship experiences and even destructive behavior. The results? “We find that people who are high in relationship effectiveness in early adulthood experience fewer, less disruptive stressful life events at age 32, which in turn predicts better sleep quality at age 37,” the study reports.

Although being single is a predictor of loneliness, it’s becoming less so with advanced age. It means as you get older, the less lonely you’ll feel about being single. In fact, this survey suggests people’s satisfaction with being single actually increases over time. One more important thing to note: The later someone was born, the more satisfied they were with being single than were their older counterparts. It’s a new world, friends. Embrace your single status with pride!",

Researcher Irum Saeed Abbasi examines addiction to social media as well as its potential effects on romantic relationships in a series of studies with concerning findings. First, he reports younger participants have higher social networking-site addiction scores. Then, social-media addicts are less likely to say that they wanted their current relationship to last for a long time. Similarly, social-media addiction also shows strong connections with infidelity-related behaviors and romantic disengagement. To prevent social from sinking your relationship, put down the phone and prioritize quality time with your partner away from screens. Go for a walk, take a trip, or simply set the table for a dinner you can have over old-fashioned, face-to-face conversation.",

Professor Jeffrey Hall from the University of Kansas has done almost 40 different studies with 15,000 people over the last thirty years. After examining so many relationships, he reports that humor is critical to building a happy relationship. Perhaps it’s that being able to laugh together builds security between partners. Then, another study from Appalachian State University reports that couples who make fun of each other regularly boast strong relationships. Again, it implies a level of comfort with one another. But remember, both people have to find it funny! Hall points out that an aggressive sense of humor does the exact opposite and hurts your relationship. We’re talking light inside jokes, not passive aggressively making sarcastic digs about their insecurities.",

This means looking for signs of personlaity disorders and mental health issues so that you avoid uncomfortable and dangerous situations. Find something you're passionate about, it can be a job/career, hobby, or just a quality you have. Do not be concerned with your looks or theirs. This means it may be a good idea to go for women who are much less attractive than you would hope. If a women is too overweight for you, simply see if they are open to losing weight, and try to help them in that process if they are. Many women want men who can protect and take care of them, are funny, charismatic, and have other desirable qualities. Read up and talk to experts about how you can build these qualities while still being yourself. If you think you yourself have mental disorders, personality disorders, or related issue, seek help from a therapist to improve yourself and personality."

If you assume a martial arts stance, it immediately tells the attacker that you know how to fight. In response, he’s likely to be more aggressive. Instead, use a confident, relaxed stance in which your hips and shoulders are forward, your arms are bent, and your hands are up and open. This conciliatory posture may mislead the attacker into thinking you’re willing to comply.

When an aggressor enters that zone, you’re uncomfortable because you know you’d need that space if you had to fight back. When you’re in an adrenalized state, you need a quarter of a second to react to an assault. This “reactionary gap” should be anticipated when you think about your comfort zone.

The good news is that most assailants are not skilled ground fighters; they’re bullies who are used to knocking women down and forcing them to comply. Remember that the heel-palm strike and eye strike work well on the ground. It’s a good idea to have a few kicks that work there, as well. In particular, the side thrust kick functions in a variety of scenarios. If you’re on the ground and your assailant is standing, it gives you an advantage because your legs are longer than his arms. That means he’ll have to expose his body to your kick if he wants to reach you. Knee strikes also function effectively on the ground. While you struggle with your attacker, he probably won’t protect his groin. Once you see an opening, get close enough to strike upward into his crotch.",

Therefore, you must be 110-percent committed to the battle. If you fight back and then pause, you give up the initial advantage you gained from using the element of surprise.

To survive, you must continue your barrage until it’s safe to stop striking and escape.",

But do you really know what's realistic? Over the long term, it's smart to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week. Generally to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week, you need to burn 500 to 1,000 calories more than you consume each day, through a lower calorie diet and regular physical activity. Depending on your weight, 5% of your current weight may be a realistic goal, at least for an initial goal. If you weigh 180 pounds (82 kilograms), that's 9 pounds (4 kilograms). Even this level of weight loss can help lower your risk of chronic health problems, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. When you're setting goals, think about both process and outcome goals. 'Walk every day for 30 minutes' is an example of a process goal. 'Lose 10 pounds' is an example of an outcome goal. It isn't essential that you have an outcome goal, but you should set process goals because changing your habits is a key to weight loss.",

If someone asks you to hang out, instead of saying “No, thanks,” you can say something like, “It was really nice meeting you, but I’m just not feeling that type of connection.” If you’re being asked out on a second date (after a pretty bad first one), you can say, “Thanks so much for our last date, but I just didn’t feel a connection,” or, “I would love to hang out again, but just as friends.” (If that’s the truth, of course.)",

If you do, stick with 'I' statements like 'I just don’t feel a romantic connection,' or 'I am not looking for a relationship right now.' More importantly, try not to put blame on the person for rejecting them. Saying something like, 'You drink too much,' or 'You aren’t my type' can make the situation more tense than it already is. Basically, take the 'it’s not you, it’s me' approach.",

It’s helpful to prepare yourself for every potential response after rejecting someone. It’s not easy for you to say, but it’s definitely harder for the person being rejected! In a perfect scenario, the person will be totally cool about it. Depending on the situation, though, you might get a response that’s emotional or even angry. It’s normal to feel bad after hurting someone’s feelings, but remember that you’re not doing anything wrong. (You can’t help that you’re not interested, you know?)",

Be mentally prepared to not have the words you're about to say be well received and approach it from that perspective, says Steinorth. If the other person gets upset, don't feed into it or argue back, as nothing good will come of it. And really, why would you want to continue to engage with a person you're not all that interested in? The best thing you can do is to let things go and, if need be, let the other person have the last word, because let's face it, it's not like you're going to see them again anyway.",

'The more time that passes, the more difficult it's going to be for you to do,' affirms Steinorth. 'People build attachments over time and the more time and energy they invest in building a relationship with you, the more hurt their feelings are going to be when you tell them that their efforts and feelings aren't mutual,' she explains.  Not to mention, he or she will also likely wonder why you didn't end things sooner and may get angry that you weren't more honest about your feelings."

                            "A model of Bishop's tendency toward singular or isolated figures, 'The Man-Moth' (1946) opens on an incisive description that was her trademark. The image of a man standing in moonlight depicts him as 'an inverted pin, the point magnetized to the moon.' With a deft twist, she envisions him like toothpaste in a tube 'forced through . . . in black scrolls on the light.' Unlike the man himself, the 'man-moth' shadow attempts the unthinkable by climbing buildings and trailing along behind his source 'like a photographer's cloth.' The fourth and fifth stanzas imperil the shadow during a subway ride, where he 'always seats himself facing the wrong way' and cowers from the dangers of the third rail. The poet merges the play of light on dark with fantasy in the sixth stanza, in which the shadow, like a mime, acquires humanity by squeezing out a tear, the pure substance of 'underground springs.' Critics have characterized Bishop's detachment as the result of emotional inertia, the atmosphere of 'The Fish' (1955). The vignette inventories physical parts, which she catalogs without dissection. The fish, sapped of fight, becomes an elder statesman who bears the marks of past challenges. The poet-speaker delights in his 'medals with their ribbons/frayed and wavering'; then, in line 75, experiences an unforeseen surprise of 'rainbow, rainbow, rainbow.' Her victory over the fish gives place to admiration. In sympathy with the water world below, she exults, 'I let the fish go.' Similarly immersed in minutiae, 'At the Fishhouses' (1955) notes a paradox: the inflexible rule of change. The poem moves through crisp air beyond the net-mender's niche to seaside structures and equipment that wear has silvered with 'creamy iridescent coats of mail.' Similar in color imagery to 'The Fish,' the poem equates the shimmer of scales with a store of experience. Through a simple poet's trick, Bishop compares coastal glamour to the old man's 'Lucky Strike,' a cigarette logo rich in implications of sensory wealth.",
                            
                            "Slaughterhouse-Five is an account of Billy Pilgrim's capture and incarceration by the Germans during the last years of World War II, and scattered throughout the narrative are episodes from Billy's life both before and after the war, and from his travels to the planet Tralfamadore (Trawl-fahm-uh-door). Billy is able to move both forwards and backwards through his lifetime in an arbitrary cycle of events. Enduring the tedious life of a 1950s optometrist in Ilium, New York, he is the lover of a former pornographic movie star on the planet Tralfamadore and simultaneously an American prisoner of war (POW) in Nazi Germany. Vonnegut uses Billy's ability to travel in time as a device to evoke a wide range of scenes from Billy's life. The multidimensional panorama points out the importance of cyclical time and psychological experience during events that receive equal emphasis in linear time. While some scenes become so jumbled that they seem to have no cause or effect, we must remember Vonnegut's comments on the title page. He suggests that this narrative is 'schizophrenic,' and he invites us to become psychologists helping Billy make sense of his life.  Slaughterhouse-Five's central topic is the horror of the Dresden bombing. As a witness to the destruction, Billy confronts fundamental questions about the meanings of life and death. Traumatized by the events in Dresden, Billy can provide no answers. As a soldier, he is dislocated in a system where there is no reward, no punishment, and no justice. Although his life as an optometrist, a husband, and a father is materially fulfilling, he is unable to find peace of mind because of the trauma he suffered in Dresden.

At least 70 chemicals in tobacco are known to cause cancer by damaging your DNA. Radon: This gas occurs in small amounts in nature, where it's harmless. But if it builds up indoors and you breathe it in, radon breaks down the lining of your lungs. It's the No. 1 cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. Asbestos: The tough, tiny fibers in asbestos help strengthen products like roof shingles, ceiling tiles, and car parts. Yet if these fibers break free and you breathe them in, they can get lodged inside your lungs. Crispy, Brown Foods: When some vegetables, like potatoes, are heated to high temps, they can give off a chemical called acrylamide. Studies show that rats who took in acrylamide in their drinking water got cancer, so researchers think humans might also. Formaldehyde: From plywood to some fabrics, this chemical is used in many household products. Studies on lab rats and people who are around formaldehyde at their jobs show it can cause cancer. Before buying any wood products or furniture for your home, find out if they contain formaldehyde. Air out your house every day and keep humidity levels low with an air conditioner or dehumidifier. Ultraviolet Rays: Studies show that ultraviolet (UV) rays, whether from the sun or a tanning bed, get absorbed into your skin and damage the cells there. Most skin cancer cases are due to UV rays. Alcohol: The more alcohol you drink, the greater your odds of getting certain kinds of cancers, such as: Head and neck, Esophageal, Breast, Liver, Colorectal, Processed Meat, Bacon, salami, pepperoni, sausage -- any meat that's been preserved or flavored can raise your chances of getting colon cancer. Experts reached that view by looking at more than 800 studies. Engine Exhaust: Trucks, buses, trains, and even some cars run on diesel fuel. The gas and soot in diesel engine exhaust are believed to cause lung cancer and other types of cancer. Pollution:  Aside from exhaust, polluted outdoor air contains dust and traces of metals and solvents that can lead to cancer. Experts know this from looking at data from over 1.2 million people across the U.S.",

This gene is missing or damaged in more than half of all cancers. Inherited p53 mutations are rare. If you have one, you have a greater risk of many different types of cancer (Cancer.net). The acquisition of de novo somatic mutations accounts for approximately 90% of all new cancer diagnoses, while the remaining 10% is due to inherited genetic traits. In this latter category, individuals harbouring germline mutations show a higher likelihood of developing potentially life-threatening cancers, often at a very young age. The study of cancer genetics has profoundly helped our understanding of cancer biology, leading to better characterised malignancies, tailored targeted therapies and the identification of individuals at high risk of cancer diagnosis. This review will discuss examples of cancer syndromes in children, adolescents and young adults, the main underlying gene mutations, and the use of genetic testing to identify gene mutation carriers. Finally, we will describe how gene mutation detection is employed for the life-long management of patients with high susceptibility to cancer, including genetic counselling, increased surveillance, early intervention and use of targeted therapies.

If a GP diagnoses you with mild depression, they may suggest waiting a short time to see if it gets better by itself. In this case, you'll be seen again by the GP after 2 weeks to monitor your progress. This is known as watchful waiting.

Find out more about walking for health and exercise for depression. Moderate to severe depression. If you have moderate to severe depression, the following treatments may be recommended. Antidepressants:   Antidepressants are medicines that treat the symptoms of depression. There are many different types of antidepressant. They have to be prescribed by a doctor, usually for depression that's moderate or severe. Combination therapy: A GP may recommend that you take a course of antidepressants plus talking therapy, particularly if your depression is quite severe. A combination of an antidepressant and CBT usually works better than having just one of these treatments. Mental health teams:  If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a mental health team made up of psychologists, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and occupational therapists.

CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. Online CBT: Online CBT is a type of CBT delivered through a computer, rather than face to face with a therapist. You'll have a series of weekly sessions and should receive support from a healthcare professional. Interpersonal therapy (IPT):  Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement. There's some evidence that IPT can be as effective as antidepressants or CBT, but more research is needed. Psychodynamic psychotherapy:  In psychodynamic (psychoanalytic) psychotherapy, a psychoanalytic therapist will encourage you to say whatever is going through your mind. This will help you become aware of hidden meanings or patterns in what you do or say that may be contributing to your problems. Counselling: Counselling is a form of therapy that helps you think about the problems you're experiencing in your life so you can find new ways of dealing with them.  Counsellors support you in finding solutions to problems, but do not tell you what to do. You can talk in confidence to a counsellor, who supports you and offers practical advice.

Science, though, tracks the seat of your emotions to the brain. Certain areas of the brain help regulate mood. Researchers believe that — more important than levels of specific brain chemicals — nerve cell connections, nerve cell growth, and the functioning of nerve circuits have a major impact on depression. Use of technology has led to a better understanding of which brain regions regulate mood and how other functions, such as memory, may be affected by depression. Areas that play a significant role in depression are the amygdala, the thalamus, and the hippocampus. Research shows that the hippocampus is smaller in some depressed people. For example, in one fMRI study published in The Journal of Neuroscience, investigators studied 24 women who had a history of depression. On average, the hippocampus was 9% to 13% smaller in depressed women compared with those who were not depressed. The more bouts of depression a woman had, the smaller the hippocampus. Stress, which plays a role in depression, may be a key factor here, since experts believe stress can suppress the production of new neurons (nerve cells) in the hippocampus. The answer may be that mood only improves as nerves grow and form new connections, a process that takes weeks. In fact, animal studies have shown that antidepressants do spur the growth and enhanced branching of nerve cells in the hippocampus. So, the theory holds, the real value of these medications may be in generating new neurons (a process called neurogenesis), strengthening nerve cell connections, and improving the exchange of information between nerve circuits. If that's the case, depression medications could be developed that specifically promote neurogenesis, with the hope that patients would see quicker results than with current treatments.

Remember: everyone has different learning techniques. What works for other students may not work for you. Just keep trying until you discover the best way to study. If you are a VU student, we will help you achieve your full potential by developing your confidence, academic ability, and study skills. With our support, you will gain essential skills for university.1. GET ORGANISED:  Taking the time to get organised will set you up well and help you achieve your learning goals. Invest in a diary, and use it to keep track of current assignment deadlines.  Bring all the material and devices you need to class, so you can participate. You may find it helpful to pack your bag the night before, so you’re ready to go first thing in the morning. 2. DON’T SKIP CLASS! Skipping class can be detrimental to your learning and achieving your study goals. It leaves gaping holes in your notes – and in your subject knowledge. Rather than juggling four subjects at once, you’ll concentrate on one unit (subject) over a four-week ‘block’ period. You’ll attend three-hour workshop-style classes, three times a week. The rest of your time can be used to study, work, see friends – whatever is most important to you. Remember to practise active listening by focusing on what your teachers are saying in class and taking notes as needed. 3. TAKE NOTES: To keep your brain engaged during class, take notes, which you can refer to later, as you refine your study techniques. Notes can help store information in your long-term memory, right there in class. These notes will be important for reviewing when you’re completing assessments and assignments. You might find it handy to condense your notes after class, so they’re clear and easy to read. Underline or highlight key points. If anything doesn’t make sense, you can seek clarification from your teacher. You can also create visual aids like flow charts and mind maps to help simplify information. For some students, these visual aids help them remember complex information and study more effectively. If you do miss a class, ask a study buddy or classmate if you can refer to their notes. This will ensure there are no holes in your own notetaking.",
                        
                            "4. TALK TO YOUR TEACHER & ASK QUESTIONS: Your teacher is, in a way, a resource who is there to be used!   You can take advantage of this interactive learning environment by asking questions during or after class, where you can get fast feedback.  Teachers can further clarify any topics you find confusing. You may even be able to get a little direction on assignments before submitting. Your teacher will no doubt be impressed with your initiative and happy to help. Read more about the Block Model principles and advantages of studying in small classes. Improve your study technique by asking questions in class.  5. SPACE OUT YOUR STUDYING:  One of the most effective ways of studying is to space out your learning sessions. If you break up your study load over several days, you’ll retain information far more readily than if you crammed in one long session. This can help deeply ingrain information, allowing you to retain it for the long term. You’ll find you achieve much better results for it.",

CREATE A STUDY PLAN – & STICK TO IT: One top study tip is to create a schedule or plan. This is incredibly helpful for time management and can help you reach your learning goals. A study plan will: motivate you to study, as you’ll have time dedicated to learning keep you organised around work, hobbies and other commitments, as you can plan ahead break your study load into manageable blocks   give you time to complete your assignments, ensuring they’re not rushed or last-minute.  IS STUDYING AT UNIVERSITY VERY DIFFERENT TO STUDYING IN HIGH SCHOOL?  The main differences between studying at university and studying at high school revolve around accountability and independence. High school teachers are more likely to chase down outstanding work. While you're studying at university, the accountability tends to be more on you to get your work done and submitted.  You may have periods of time during high school that revolve around study, such as free periods or the homework you're expected to complete after school or on weekends.  University brings with it more freedom, allowing you to plan out your day. You can independently choose when you wish to study, around commitments such as classes and work, exercise and any social activities. This is one of the main reasons why a study schedule is so helpful. Read more about how to make an effective study plan.

DON’T JUST RE-READ BUT STUDY:  When you are reading and re-reading texts and notes, you’re not studying. This is because you’re not engaging with the material.  You’ll discover that you have trouble remembering class notes if you’re not using active studying techniques. Instead of reading, try: creating concept maps and diagrams explaining concepts to yourself step by step. formulating questions and problems that you can come back to and solve, effectively creating a quiz for yourself becoming a teacher or tutor to your study group or partner and learning the course material by explaining concepts to them.  Use active studying techniques to really engage with your notes.",
                            
                            "8. SET UP A QUIET STUDY SPACE: It is important to have a designated study area that is free from distraction and will allow you to study effectively. When you settle into your study area, you will know you are there to learn. This mindset will help with your overall motivation to study. Choose a study space that is quiet, well-lit and in a low-traffic area. Don’t, say, study at a dining table when you’re going to be constantly distracted by housemates or family members moving in and out of the kitchen! If there’s nowhere suitable for study at home, try your local or university library. Libraries are naturally quiet and many have designated areas for study. Victoria University has seven libraries across its campuses. Check the opening hours calendar to find a time that works for you. You can also try out VU’s student lounges and learning spaces. For many students, the greatest distraction is their phone. You may find it helpful to switch your phone to silent – or even off – for the duration of your study session. You can also use apps such as Freedom to block non-essential apps from your phone, while you’re trying to learn.  9. TEST YOURSELF: Getting someone to quiz you – or quizzing yourself – is great retrieval practice. This learning technique helps you commit information to your long-term memory and easily retrieve it when needed. Recalling an answer to a question improves learning, as does writing down that answer – you’re committing it to memory. You might find it helpful to create flash cards each time you learn a new topic. Flash cards can have questions on them or have a prompt that triggers the recall of relevant information. Ask a parent, friend, housemate or study buddy to quiz you, using your flash cards. The act of creating them alone will help you better retain information and is an effective study technique. 10. FIND A STUDY BUDDY OR JOIN A STUDY GROUP: One of the best ways to study is to share the experience with another person. It can be beneficial to find a study buddy – or even form a study group with like-minded students. Your study buddy/group can: keep you motivated, help you stay accountable, quiz and test you on course material, read over your work to offer advice, share resources, such as textbooks, lowering expenses. Read about how to find a study buddy or a study group and how this can improve your results and study more effectively. Study effectively with the help of like-minded students.

They'll play it safe and fall back on whatever they already know that works. They'll keep giving you exactly what you've always gotten, nothing more or less. The thing is, avoiding a negative outcome is not a great measure of success. Avoiding negative outcomes doesn't lead to greatness. On the other hand, if you want people to work really hard, reward them for that. If you want people to take risks, try new things, and come up with new ways of doing things, incentivize them for their effort. Those things don't always lead to what we think of traditionally as success. Sometimes they are messy. Sometimes they fail. Sometimes the effort will cost you a lot of money. The point is, that's not necessarily a bad thing if what you're trying to do is build something new. (inc.com Sundar Pichai).",

This means that the motivation behind your behavior is either the seeking of a specific external reward (higher salary, social clout) or the avoidance of a specific external punishment (getting fired). It turns out, this orientation is terrible for long term productivity. The external thresholds against which we measure our worth are usually dictated by the environments we’re in. So, when we become. So focused on the goal and the precise steps needed to achieve it, we can fall into the trap of socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP). This can lead to depression, test anxiety, and decreased help-seeking. These re all unpleasant feelings, and what do we do to avoid these things? Procrastinate. When effort, not outcome, is rewarded, we are ore likely to take risks. That’s how innovation is born. When it’s not just about the destination, we care more about the journey. That’s because when we’re intrinsically motivated, we feel a sense of ownership over our work, connect deeply to its metaphysical meaning, brush up on relevant skills that make us more competent, and feel confident in the story we’re pushing for.

In February, we released findings from the world’s largest trial of a four-day week with no reduction in pay, involving some 60 organizations in Britain across a range of sectors from public relations to healthcare to manufacturing. The results were striking: Employees and companies using the new schedule are thriving. Why are reduced working hours suddenly on the agenda after years of not being taken seriously? The most important reason is the pandemic. Leaders of the first organization to be part of our research attributed their decision to the COVID-driven shift to remote work. Dr. Adam Husney, the chief executive of the health information firm Healthwise, explained: “Once we realized we could trust our employees with where they work, we also realized we could trust them about how much time they work.”  Our research suggests that the four-day, 32-hour week is not only feasible; it’s better for workers and employers. In collaboration with the nonprofit 4 Day Week Global, we’ve been tracking what happens when companies switch to the curtailed schedule with no reduction in pay after a two-month process of figuring out how to maintain productivity and performance. We’ve found that employee well-being is markedly improved. Of more than 100 companies with thousands of workers around the world, nearly 70% experienced reduced rates of burnout. Stress fell. Reported physical and mental health improved. People felt less anxious and fatigued, exercised more and slept better. Their life satisfaction rose, and conflicts among work, family and life plummeted. But it’s not just workers who benefited. On a 10-point scale, companies rated the success of the trials at a robust 8.5 or higher. Perhaps the most persuasive metric is that most are opting to continue with the shorter schedule. Only a handful of the organizations that have participated in the trials have reverted to the five-day week.’ (LA Times)",

After all, let’s be real, it’s pretty much impossible for everyone to love their job. But it should not be something that you resent, even though you don’t necessarily love it all the time. Your work should not stress you out every day, nor make you feel like you are less worthy. However, your work should not be your entire life either, which is why I wanted to address and discuss the following dilemma— working to live or living to work — which one is better? The Solution — Balancing Between Life and Work: It’s not always easy to find a balance between life and work, or the personal and the professional, but it’s nonetheless possible. If you are feeling unhappy with your work or life, the balance is your best solution to get rid of the negative feelings. It won’t be easy, and it will take you a lot of time until you get it right, but it will definitely be worth it. So make sure to work on yourself and your career. Make sure that you are always exploring your potential and working on your growth. Don’t waste your time with a job that makes it hard for you to get out of bed every single day. At the same time, try to spend quality time outside of work. Don’t bring your work home, and give your attention to your closest ones. Take your chances and make your work and your life as comfortable as you can. After all, life is too short to be living without being happy and content with ourselves. Having a job should not be only about paying the bills. It should be at least bearable. But, remember that you are much more than just your work, no matter how much you enjoy in it, or how good you are at doing what you do.  Make the balance between these two, and you will find that life can be much better than you thought. The balance means you are handling life, and that you are doing a pretty good job in that as well. Adulting should not be hard, but it’s up to you to make the necessary choices to improve your life. So it’s doesn’t matter which one is better, whether working to live or living to work. What matters is that you are happy, and that you stick to the things that you love and experience life to the fullest. (Medium.com)",

                                                            
                                            "(Opinion, something to think about). A lot of people say that you should always have a backup plan before quitting your job: have another job lined up, make sure you’re already making money with your side gig, and so on. In this myth, I want to focus on the word “always.” I’m not about to make a blanket statement that suggests ditching all planning and reason. But hear me out. With the one-foot-in-one-foot-out mindset, we can sometimes hold ourselves back. And when we hold ourselves back, we risk the chance of neither goal succeeding. Or we get scared of juggling two ideas, so we close one door and retreat, and we don’t put our everything in it. The reality is if we want to chase down a dream job, then we have to put in more than 50 percent effort. Easier said than done, right? But that’s just the way things are, and for good reason. However, take this with a grain of salt. There are times to jump in wholeheartedly, and there are times to wade in slowly and carefully. If you haven’t saved up money to afford not working for a while (finding a satisfying job can take anywhere from two months to a year), then maybe don’t quit with the mentality of “I’ll figure it out.” (On the other other hand, though, sometimes our greatest achievements come when we have our backs against the wall—hence my statement above that one size does not fit all.) If your current job is severely affecting your mental, emotional, or physical health, no one would blame you for quitting without having another job lined up (but see #1). But if you’re just getting antsy for a change, patience and planning might help Future You more. If you don’t see any potential professional growth where you are, it might be time to change companies or careers. However, every successful person has had to pay their dues and work their way through less glamorous jobs. If you’re at a necessary stepping-stone job, maybe don’t quit just yet. Backup plans, however, diffuse our energy. Diffused energy equals diffused results. Your dream, and thus your well-being, deserve your all, which means that risk is inherent in chasing your passions. When you take a risk, you’ve got a better chance of being successful. This month, I challenge you to commit to playing a bigger game. Minimize your backup plans—commit and go! When was the last time you collapsed from hard work and still felt satisfied? And just to be clear, there’s a difference between having a plan and a backup plan. Spend some time planning how you would go about starting to envision a new career (Designing Your Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans is a GREAT resource) and prototyping  your next steps, of course. But don’t let planning get in the way of doing.",
                                                                                                                     
                                        "Examine yourself. What you enjoy doing and what you value can be helpful indicators about how you’d like to spend your working time. We’re not talking about finding and following your passion—that approach tends to be misleading and confusing. But it’s common to want to feel energized and even excited about what you do. Ask: What do you enjoy learning about? How do you like to spend your time? Do you enjoy manual labor or mental labor? Do you enjoy working outside or inside? What is most important in your life? What are your priorities in life? Where do you find meaning? What change would you like to be a part of? What does success mean to you? What do you want more of? Which of your strengths do you enjoy the most? Which of your skills are you most proud of? Reflect on your motivations. Salary/Benefits, a passion, helping/saving people, autonomy, work/life balance, flexibility, career growth. Think about your long-term life goals. For example, if you want to work in the same industry 10 years from now, research which industries are poised to continue growing over the next decade and which to possibly avoid due to increasing automation or other factors. Take different self-assessment tests. There are a number of tests you can take to evaluate everything from your personality to your strengths—and even what career might be a good fit. Seek out professional resources. In addition to thinking through the areas mentioned above on your own, you can also turn to various career resources for more guided help. College career center: If you’re still in college, take advantage of the career resources your college or university may offer. You may be able to meet with a counselor or advisor trained to help you transition from college to a career. Career coach: You can find a career coach trained to help clients learn more about what kinds of work would best suit them. Career coaches are an additional expense, so make sure to research their credentials, experience, and background to make sure they will be a good fit for your needs.",

Transform What You Already Enjoy Into a Hobby: Even if you don’t have something that you consider a hobby, there’s definitely some activity that you enjoy—and chances are, there’s a way to transform it into a full-fledged hobby. “I always ask people what it is they like to do for fun,” says Weiler. “It’s a good thing to explore—because things like ‘eating’ and ‘watching sports’ could easily be turned into hobbies such as ‘taking cooking classes’ or ‘joining a softball team.’” 2. Reclaim Your Childhood Interests:  Think about the hobbies you used to enjoy before work, life, and #adulting got in the way. When you were a kid, what did you like to do? Did you spend hours finger-painting masterpieces to hang on the fridge? If so, you might want to explore taking an art class. Were you constantly getting dressed in costume and putting on shows for your friends? Then maybe you can check out a local acting troupe. Or maybe you spent the entire year looking forward to Field Day at school—in which case, you could explore joining an adult kickball or flag football league. Take an Assessment: The most fun hobby in the world for one person can be downright torturous for another—and vice versa. People tend to enjoy hobbies that appeal to their own unique strengths, interests, and personality characteristics. According to Weiler, there are a number of personality assessments that can help you figure out which hobbies might be the right fit. Two of the most effective? The Strong Interest Inventory, which can help you identify key interests, and the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, which can give you deeper insight into your personality type. These assessments can help you figure out which hobbies are most aligned with who you are and offer insight into what you might enjoy. 4. Start Trying Things (and See What Sticks). The truth is, no matter how you approach finding a new hobby, it can be hit or miss. For example, you might think crafting is the perfect creative outlet—only to find it feels boring and monotonous. That’s OK! If you really want to find a hobby you love, you need to be willing to put yourself out there—and be just as willing to accept that not everything you try is going to be a slam dunk. Think of anything you might find interesting—whether that’s kite surfing, macramé, or karate—and take a class. If you like it, great! Keep pursuing it. If not, cross it off the list and move on to the next potentially interesting thing. (the muse)",

Keep it professional.  Don’t go overboard on the really personal items, and make sure to keep work front and centre. Inspiring artwork or a motivational quote works. That honeymoon photo of you and your spouse on the beach in your swimsuits? Probably not the best idea. 2. Keep it clean and functional. Don’t clutter up your office space with too much stuff. Keep your desk surface and your floor space clear of clutter, papers and piles of books. 3. Make it healthy.  One of the best ways to decorate is naturally - so you can add beauty and also something that will enhance the health of your office space. Plants work wonders for this.  You can also freshen the air in your office by using a Himalayan salt lamp. It purifies plus it gives off a nice warm glow, making your space feel cozy and homey. 4. Make it comfortable.  In addition to a good desk chair, you might want to have a comfortable back or butt pillow and/or throw hanging around so that you’re more comfortable in it all day. 5. Light it right. Consider adding a desk lamp with softer lighting so that you can see well what you’re doing and also create a warm vibe that feels more like home. 6. Put up some art. It might be one nice piece of artwork that you love, a framed inspirational quote, or perhaps a cork board with a few photos, postcards or sayings that bring you joy.  Artwork is a lovely way to make your space more personal and beautiful but still be professional. 7. Put out a few photos. Maybe. You can certainly personalize your space with photos of the family or your dog. But keep them tasteful and limit it to 1-3 photos. 8. Accessorize. Add items that are functional but also personalized to your own style and taste. You could: use a funky mug or a vintage jar to hold pens and pencils, employ a beautiful bowl for paper clips, use an antique box to hold business cards, put your plant in a ceramic planter in your favourite colour, bring in a lovely vase for fresh flowers, use a textured woven basket as your in-box tray, use a basket or bin as a phone charging station to help hide ugly cords, bring in your favourite mug for coffee or tea at your desk.",

Taking the initiative to meet people helps establish an initial relationship that can develop the foundation for future quality relationships. 2. Learn and use their names: Take the time to learn your coworkers' names and greet them by name. 3. Use greetings and ask questions: Say 'hello' and 'goodbye' to your colleagues when you come to work at the start of your shift and when you leave at the end. Ask friendly questions about their weekend, hobbies or any information they might volunteer. Paying attention and asking questions about them shows you care. 4. Be positive: It's important to have a positive attitude at work. When you maintain a positive persona, your coworkers are more likely to want to be around you. It can also help you find other positive, upbeat individuals with whom you can discuss ideas and develop friendships. 6. Bring in coffee or food: Bring in coffee or baked goods for breakfast to share with your team. Leave the treats in the break room with a small note, or bring them around the office and hand them out in person. 7. Eat lunch or get coffee with coworkers. Rather than eating at your desk, have lunch in your workplace's kitchen, cafeteria or break room. Or, if there’s a good restaurant or coffee shop nearby, ask coworkers if they want to go there on your lunch break. 8. Offer to help: Another way to improve your workplace relationships is to help your peers. 9. Plan activities outside of work: If your company hosts regular social activities outside of work, make an effort to attend. 10. Start a chatroom: Often, companies have a chat program for discussing projects, asking questions and sharing files. You could start a chat channel or room for coworkers who might share a common interest."

What to do before a Hurricane Strikes: Be informed by receiving alerts, warnings, and public safety information before, during, and after emergencies. Know Your Zone. Learn if you live in a hurricane evacuation zone. Find out whether your property is in a flood-prone or high-risk area. If you receive medical treatment or home health care services, work with your medical provider to determine how to maintain care and service if you are unable to leave your home or have to evacuate during. Assemble an emergency kit. Ensure your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working and have fresh batteries. Consider purchasing a generator to provide power during an outage. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and learn how to use it safely before an outage. Make a record of your personal property by taking photos or videos of your belongings. Store these records in a safe place. Consider attaching temporary plywood covers to protect windows and sliding doors. If you must be out in the storm: Six inches of swiftly moving water can knock you off of your feet. Don’t drive through flooded roads. Cars can be swept away in just two feet of moving water. If your vehicle is trapped in rapidly moving water, stay in the vehicle. Take only essential items.",
                            
                            "If told to shelter in place: Stay indoors and away from windows. What to do after a Hurricane has passed: Call 9-1-1 to report emergencies, including downed power lines and gas leaks. Call 2-1-1 to obtain shelter locations and other disaster information. Stay away from downed utility wires.  Always assume a downed power line is live. Stay out of damaged buildings and away from affected areas and or roads until authorities deem them safe. Listen to news reports to learn if your water supply is safe to drink. Until local authorities proclaim your water supply safe, boil water for at least one minute before drinking or using it for food preparation. Never touch electrical equipment while you are wet or standing in water. Have wells checked for contamination from bacteria and chemicals before using. Have damaged septic tanks or leaching systems repaired as soon as possible to reduce potential health hazards. If you believe there is a gas leak, go outdoors immediately, and do not turn electrical switches or appliances on or off. If you turned off your gas, a licensed professional is required to turn it back on. Use generators and grills outside because their fumes contain carbon monoxide. Make sure your carbon monoxide detectors are working as it is a silent, odorless, killer. Floodwater and mud may be contaminated by oil, gasoline, or raw sewage. Consider using professional cleaning and repair services. (Mass.gov)",
                            
                            "What to do Before a Flood. Be informed by receiving alerts, warnings, and public safety information before, during, and after emergencies. Find out whether your property is in a flood-prone or high-risk area. Contact your local Emergency Management Director to find out if your home or workplace is downstream from a dam and learn more about your community’s risk of flooding. Have a plan to go to higher ground quickly if necessary. Assemble an emergency kit. Make a record of your personal property by taking photos or videos of your belongings. Flood losses are not typically covered under renter and homeowner’s insurance policies. Flood insurance is available in most communities. What to do During a Flood Watch or Flash Flood Watch: Listen to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio or to a local news station for the latest information. Be alert to changing weather conditions and be ready to move to higher ground. Tie down or bring in outdoor objects (patio furniture, children's toys, trash cans, etc.) that could be swept away or damaged during flooding. Consider unplugging sensitive electronic equipment before flooding occurs. But, do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water. Elevate items stored in your basement to prevent damage. What to do During a Flood Warning or Flash Flood Warning: Move immediately to higher ground or stay on high ground. Continue to check the media for emergency information. Follow instructions from public safety officials. If advised to evacuate, do so immediately. If you must evacuate your home, take only essential items. If you must evacuate or are traveling during flooding, remember: Do not walk through flowing water. Most drownings occur during flash floods. Six inches of swiftly moving water can knock you off of your feet.  Cars can be swept away in only two feet of moving water. Do not drive around road barriers. Roads and bridges may be washed out or structurally unsound. What to do After a Flood: Call 9-1-1 to report emergencies including downed power lines and gas leaks. Call 2-1-1 to obtain shelter locations and other disaster information. Stay away from downed utility wires. Always assume a downed power line is live. Electrocution is also a serious danger in floods as electrical currents can travel through water. Look before you step. Boil water for at least one minute before drinking or using it for cooking. (Mass.gov)",
                                                                                              
                                        "During a tornado: If you are in a house: Go to the basement or take shelter in a small interior ground floor room such as a bathroom, closet or hallway. If you have no basement, protect yourself by taking shelter under a heavy table or desk. In all cases, stay away from windows, outside walls and doors. If you live on a farm. Livestock hear and sense impending tornadoes. If your family or home is at risk, the livestock will be a non-issue. If your personal safety is not an issue, you may only have time to open routes of escape for your livestock. Open the gate, if you must, and then exit the area in a tangent direction away from the expected path of the twister. If you are in an office or apartment building. Take shelter in an inner hallway or room, ideally in the basement or on the ground floor. Do not use the elevator.  Stay away from windows. If you are in a gymnasium, church or auditorium. Large buildings with wide-span roofs may collapse if a tornado hits. If possible, find shelter in another building. If you are in one of these buildings and cannot leave, take cover under a sturdy structure such as a table or desk. Avoid cars and mobile homes. More than half of all deaths from tornadoes Find shelter elsewhere, preferably in a building with a strong foundation.  If no shelter is available, lie down in a ditch away from the car or mobile home. Beware of flooding from downpours and be prepared to move. If you spot a tornado in the distance go to the nearest solid shelter. If the tornado is close, get out of your car and take cover in a low-lying area, such as a ditch. Get as close to the ground as possible, protect your head and watch for flying debris. A tornado is deceptive. It may appear to be standing still but is, in fact, moving toward you. (California)",

                                    "Drop. Cover. Hold on. In most situations, you can protect yourself if you immediately: DROP down onto your hands and knees before the earthquake knocks you down. This position protects you from falling but allows you to still move if necessary. COVER your head and neck (and your entire body if possible) underneath a sturdy table or desk. If there is no shelter nearby, get down near an interior wall or next to low-lying furniture that won’t fall on you, and cover your head and neck with your arms and hands. HOLD ON to your shelter (or to your head and neck) until the shaking stops. Be prepared to move with your shelter if the shaking shifts it around. If you are inside, stay inside. DO NOT run outside or to other rooms during an earthquake. You are less likely to be injured if you stay where you are. If possible, within the few seconds before shaking intensifies, quickly move away from glass, hanging objects, bookcases, china cabinets, or other large furniture that could fall. Watch for falling objects, such as bricks from fireplaces and chimneys, light fixtures, wall hangings, high shelves, and cabinets with doors that could swing open. If available nearby, grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and broken glass. If you are in the kitchen, quickly turn off the stove and take cover at the first sign of shaking. If you are in bed, hold on and stay there, protecting your head with a pillow. You are less likely to be injured staying where you are. Broken glass on the floor can cause injuries if you walk or roll onto the floor. DO NOT stand in a doorway. You are safer under a table. In modern houses, doorways are no stronger than any other part of the house. Doorways do not protect you from the most likely source of injury − falling or flying objects. Most earthquake-related injuries and deaths are caused by falling or flying objects (such as TVs, lamps, glass, or bookcases), or by being knocked to the ground.",

Move away from windows and outside walls. Stay in the building. DO NOT use the elevators. Do not rush for the doorways. Others will have the same idea. Move away from display shelves containing objects that may fall. Stay inside if you are inside. Move away from buildings, utility wires, sinkholes, and fuel and gas lines. The greatest danger from falling debris is just outside doorways and close to outer walls of buildings. Go to an open area away from trees, telephone poles, and buildings. Once in the open, get down low and stay there until the shaking stops. The area near the outside walls of a building is the most dangerous place to be. Windows, facades, and architectural details are often the first parts of the building to collapse. Stay away from this danger zone. If you are in a moving vehicle, stop as quickly and safely as possible. Move your car to the shoulder or curb, away from utility poles, overhead wires, and under- or overpasses. Stay in the car and set the parking brake. A car is a good place to stay until the shaking stops. If a power line falls on the car, stay inside until a trained person removes the wire. Walk quickly, rather than drive, to avoid traffic, debris, and other hazards. If you are unable to move from a bed or chair, protect yourself from falling objects by covering up with blankets and pillows (CDC).",
                                                         
                            "A tsunami is a series of enormous ocean waves caused by earthquakes, underwater landslides, volcanic eruptions or asteroids. A tsunami can kill or injure people and damage or destroy buildings and infrastructure as waves come in and go out. Tsunamis can: Travel 20-30 miles per hour with waves 10-100 feet high. Cause flooding and disrupt transportation, power, communications and the water supply. Happen anywhere along U.S. coasts. Coasts that border the Pacific Ocean or Caribbean have the greatest risk.  IF YOU ARE UNDER A TSUNAMI WARNING: If caused by an earthquake, Drop, Cover, then Hold On to protect yourself from the earthquake first. Get to high ground as far inland as possible. Be alert to signs of a tsunami, such as a sudden rise or draining of ocean waters. Listen to emergency information and alerts. Always follow the instructions from local emergency managers.  Evacuate: DO NOT wait! Leave as soon as you see any natural signs of a tsunami or receive an official tsunami warning.  If you are in a boat, go out to sea.  Know and practice community evacuation plans. Some at-risk communities have maps with evacuation zones and routes. Map out your routes from home, work and play. Pick shelters 100 feet or more above sea level, or at least one mile inland.  Create a family emergency communication plan that has an out-of-state contact. Plan where to meet if you get separated. Standard homeowner’s insurance does not cover flood or earthquake damage.  If you are outside of the tsunami hazard zone and receive a warning, stay where you are unless officials tell you otherwise. Leave immediately if you are told to do so. Evacuation routes often are marked by a wave with an arrow in the direction of higher ground.   If you are in the water, then grab onto something that floats, such as a raft or tree trunk. If you are in a boat, face the direction of the waves and head out to sea. If you are in a harbor, go inland. Be Safe AFTER:  Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris. Water may be deeper than it appears.  Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Underground or downed power lines can electrically charge water. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. Stay away from damaged buildings, roads and bridges. If you become injured or sick and need medical attention, contact your healthcare provider and shelter in place, if possible. Call 9-1-1 if you are experiencing a medical emergency.  Document property damage with photographs. Conduct an inventory and contact your insurance company for assistance.

                                                "Warning Information for Monsoon Season: Armed with Doppler radars, powerful supercomputers, advanced weather satellites, automated weather and stream gages, and an advanced lightning detection network, forecasters at the National Weather Service are able to provide highly accurate severe weather warnings. Advanced National Weather Service computer systems now allow warnings to be generated in seconds for highly detailed areas. Those warnings are then transmitted to the public, the media and emergency management officials via NOAA Weather Radio, the Emergency Alert System, and the Internet. Television meteorologists play critical roles in the warning process. They relay National Weather Service warnings to the public and provide additional detail about the storms, what they are doing and where they are going. Weather Terminology — Understanding Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. A watch means that potentially life threatening weather or flooding is possible, or may occur in a matter of hours. Pay close attention to the weather, and tune into TV, radio, or NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts frequently. Warnings (Severe Thunderstorm, Flash Flood, Dust Storm, or in rare cases, Tornado) mean that life-threatening weather is about to occur, or has been reported. Take action immediately. Flood Advisories mean heavy rains will cause minor flooding of washes, streams, and typical flood-prone areas. Flooding in this situation is usually not serious. If the flooding does become life threatening, then the flood advisory is upgraded to a Flash Flood Warning. Warnings are not issued for lightning, mainly because most thunderstorms, no matter how weak, produce deadly cloud-to-ground lightning.",
                                                            
                                                                                                        
                                                "Winter Storm Watches: It is likely that winter storm warning, blizzard warning, or ice storm warning criteria will be met due to the conditions of an upcoming storm. Winter Storm Warning:  6” of snow or more in a 12-hour period (or 8” of snow or more in a 24-hour period) expected within next 12 to 36 hours. Blizzard Warning — Sustained wind gusts greater than or equal to 35 mph AND considerable falling and/or blowing snow, resulting in reduced visibility of less than 1/4 mile for at least three hours. Ice Storm Warning — ½ inch or more of freezing rain. Before a Winter Storm: Be informed by receiving alerts, warnings, and public safety information before, during, and after emergencies. Create and review your family emergency plan. If you receive dialysis, medical treatments or home health care services, work with your medical provider to determine how to maintain care and service if you are unable to leave your home for a period of time. Assemble an emergency kit. Add seasonal supplies to your emergency kit, such as extra winter clothing and blankets. Prepare for possible power outages. If your medical equipment uses electricity, talk to health care providers, utility company & your personal support network for options during a power outage. If you’ll need assistance during an outage, talk to family, friends & your support network. Consider purchasing a generator to provide power during an outage. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and learn how to use it safely before an outage. Remove dead or rotting trees and branches around your home that could fall and cause injury or damage. Clear clogged rain gutters to allow water to flow away from your home. Melting snow and ice can build up if gutters are clogged with debris. Ensure your smoke and carbon monoxide alarms are working and have fresh batteries. Ensure you have sufficient heating fuel and consider safe backup heating options such as fireplaces or woodstoves.",
                            
                            "Ensure your vehicle is ready for safe winter driving. Keep the gas tank at least half-full and have a Winter Emergency Car Kit in the trunk. During a Winter Storm: Minimize outdoor activities. Drive only if it is absolutely necessary. If you must drive, utilize MEMA’s winter driving safety tips. Bundle up as much as possible. Watch for signs of frostbite and hypothermia. After a Winter Storm: Continue to monitor media for emergency information. Follow instructions from public safety officials. Call 9-1-1 to report emergencies, including downed power lines and gas leaks. Check with your local authorities or call 2-1-1 to find locations of warming centers or shelters near you or for other storm-related questions. In the event of power outages during cold weather, you may need to go to a warming center or emergency shelter to stay warm. Report power outages to your utility company. Stay away from downed utility wires. Always assume a downed power line is live. Stay off streets and roads until they are clear of snow. Use caution and take frequent breaks when shoveling snow to prevent overexertion. Overexertion can bring on a heart attack—a major cause of death in the winter. Clear exhaust vents from direct vent gas furnace systems to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Make sure your carbon monoxide detectors are working as it is a silent, odorless, killer. Clear snow from around vehicle exhaust pipes before starting the vehicle to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

If not, you should give up on that idea. However, if you truly believe in an idea that you want to make a reality, you cannot just give up because it seems very difficult or nearly impossible. Real perseverance is battling even harder even in the face of almost certain failure. A true champion snatches victory from the jaws of defeat.

In general, we have important things that are due soon, non-important things due soon, important things that are not due soon, and non-important things that aren't due soon. The key is to determine what's important to you, and to do the important things that aren't due soon ASAP. This way, you'd almost never have important things that are due soon.

Write down your goals 2. Make your goals SMART It doesn’t matter if they’re personal goals or work goals. After writing down your goals, you need to make sure they’re SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Oriented. The acronym SMART was created in 1981 when George T. Doran, a consultant and former Director of Corporate Planning for Washington Water Power Company, published a paper titled “There’s a S.M.A.R.T. Way to Write Management’s Goals and Objectives”. Since then, this system has gained worldwide popularity and is one of the most respected ways of setting goals. Thus, a SMART goal is: Specific: clear as water, unambiguous. Measurable: with specific criteria that assess its achievement. Achievable: it cannot be impossible to accomplish. Realistic: within reach and relevant to your life purpose. Time-Oriented: it needs a deadline. Although ideally, all goals should be SMART, the author explains that not all goals have to fulfill the 5 SMART criteria in the original document. Not everything is, for example, measurable. 3. Determine what you need to do to achieve them: Achieving your goals doesn’t depend only on your will. You need to spend time, sometimes money, have years of training, and even some help. So after you have set your goals, it’s time to ask yourself what you need to achieve them. Factors such as time, information, training, money, and support are some factors external to your motivation that you should consider. 4. Work your goals into your future plans: Now that you know exactly where you want to go and what you need to get there, it’s time to lay out a plan. Part of what makes your goals realistic is your ability to include them in your future plans and work toward them. So having a plan of action that helps you determine exactly how you will reach your goal is crucial. Be creative and look for solutions outside the box. 5. Evaluate and readjust your goals if need. Finally, our tip is to be flexible with your goals. Sometimes things happen, and not everything goes as we predict. So it’s important to have the permeability to realize when a goal is no longer realistic due to various factors and adjust it.",

                            "Psychopathy is a neuropsychiatric disorder marked by deficient emotional responses, lack of empathy, and poor behavioral controls, commonly resulting in persistent antisocial deviance and criminal behavior. 1. Superficial Charm. Bob, the new guy at work, seems talkative and interested in getting to know you and others at work. He seemed to be a likable guy, at first. Soon, you begin to get the feeling that he’s just a little too slick and artificial. 2. Puffed-Up Self-Esteem. He’s the guy who always takes the credit, whether he deserves it or not. Not only is he a grandiose blow-heard, but—and this is important—he devalues others who he perceives as a competitor. His desire is not just to win, but to dominate, even if it means that he must be destructive.  3. Deceitfulness. This trait is related to distorted self-esteem, an impaired ability to bond with other people, and a need to always be on top. To get there or perceive himself as such, the psychopath will lie, cheat, manipulate, corrode the truth and rationalize to the point that reality is so assaulted that it’s on life support. 4. Shallow Emotions. What can make this particular trait so jarring is that, as previously noted, the psychopath is superficially engaging and can seem expressively “present.” The depth of emotions is belied by a callous indifference. You might be jarred, for example, when you realize that the seemingly interested guy you're talking to abruptly changes the topic of conversation, just as you were telling him about your friend’s automobile accident. It begins to dawn on you that he sees others as instruments to be self-servingly employed. 5. Boredom and a Need for Stimulation. A propensity to experience boredom is related to a strong stimulation-seeking urge, together with an emotional shallowness. Without much of a true connection to other people and with a temperament that is always searching for thrills and excitement, the psychopath is quick to take chances and engage in risky behaviors. 6. A History of Shady Conduct. Since the psychopath has little to no moral center, his thrill-seeking behavior has no bounds, which over time might catch up with him. It's usually too late for his victims, however.",

Not respecting the feelings and emotions of others. Constant lying or deception. Being callous. Difficulty recognizing emotion. Manipulation. Arrogance. Violating the rights of others through dishonest actions. Impulsiveness.  Risk-taking. Difficulty appreciating the negative aspects of their behavior. Some with sociopathy may not realize that what they’re doing is wrong while others may simply not care. And sometimes, Dr. Coulter says, it can be both. 'There’s just a total lack of empathy or recognizing that what they’ve done has hurt someone or it’s only benefited themselves,” he says. “And sometimes they might recognize what they’re doing is wrong, they just don’t care or they justify it to themselves.'",

People with the disorder can: Have an unreasonably high sense of self-importance and require constant, excessive admiration. Feel that they deserve privileges and special treatment. Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements. Make achievements and talents seem bigger than they are. Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate. Believe they are superior to others and can only spend time with or be understood by equally special people. Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important. Expect special favors and expect other people to do what they want without questioning them. Take advantage of others to get what they want. Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others. Be envious of others and believe others envy them.  Behave in an arrogant way, brag a lot and come across as conceited. Insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car or office. At the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they view as criticism. They can: Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special recognition or treatment. Have major problems interacting with others and easily feel slighted. React with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior. Have difficulty managing their emotions and behavior. Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change. Withdraw from or avoid situations in which they might fail. Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection. Have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, humiliation and fear of being exposed as a failure.  When to see a doctor: People with narcissistic personality disorder may not want to think that anything could be wrong, so they usually don't seek treatment. If they do seek treatment, it's more likely to be for symptoms of depression, drug or alcohol misuse, or another mental health problem. What they view as insults to self-esteem may make it difficult to accept and follow through with treatment. If you recognize aspects of your personality that are common to narcissistic personality disorder or you're feeling overwhelmed by sadness, consider reaching out to a trusted health care provider or mental health provider.

Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home. Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:  Feeling sad or having a depressed mood. Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed.  Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting. Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much. Loss of energy or increased fatigue. Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough to be observable by others). Feeling worthless or guilty. Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions. Thoughts of death or suicide.  Symptoms must last at least two weeks and must represent a change in your previous level of functioning for a diagnosis of depression. Also, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.  But being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways: Grief and depression can co-exist For some people, the death of a loved one, losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression. When grief and depression co-occur, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Distinguishing between grief and depression is important and can assist people in getting the help, support or treatment they need. 988 suicide hotline.",
                                                              

                                    "What is ADHD? Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders affecting children. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention (not being able to keep focus), hyperactivity (excess movement that is not fitting to the setting) and impulsivity (hasty acts that occur in the moment without thought). ADHD is considered a chronic and debilitating disorder and is known to impact the individual in many aspects of their life including academic and professional achievements, interpersonal relationships, and daily functioning (Harpin, 2005). ADHD can lead to poor self-esteem and social function in children when not appropriately treated (Harpin et al., 2016). Adults with ADHD may experience poor self-worth, sensitivity towards criticism, and increased self-criticism possibly stemming from higher levels of criticism throughout life (Beaton, et al., 2022). Of note, ADHD presentation and assessment in adults differs; this page focuses on children. Symptoms and Diagnosis: Many children may have difficulties sitting still, waiting their turn, paying attention, being fidgety, and acting impulsively. However, children who meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD, differ in that their symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, organization, and/or inattention are noticeably greater than expected for their age or developmental level. These symptoms lead to significant suffering and cause problems at home, at school or work, and in relationships. The observed symptoms are not the result of an individual being defiant or not being able to understand tasks or instructions. There are three main types of ADHD: Predominantly inattentive presentation. Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation. Combined presentation. A diagnosis is based on the presence of persistent symptoms that have occurred over a period of time and are noticeable over the past six months. While ADHD can be diagnosed at any age, this disorder begins in childhood.

The worker co-op is, in principle, designed to provide benefits not just to the founding members but also to all future employee/members. Worker cooperatives are emerging as an organizational model responding to the changes within the world of work. They have a specific democratic governance structure of member-worker-owners, where decisions are made by those directly involved in the enterprise. Any type of business can be worker-owned and controlled as a cooperative, and worker cooperatives can provide ways for organizing new forms of work with less dependence on the employer and increased flexibility and collaboration among workers. The ILO’s work on worker cooperatives looks into how they are being used as a response strategy to the changes in the world of work, including through union engagement, worker buyouts, cooperatives of freelancers, as well as cooperatives using online platforms.",

CEOs, CFOs, presidents and vice presidents—what's the difference? With the changing corporate horizon, it has become increasingly difficult to keep track of what people do and where they stand on the corporate ladder. Should we be paying more attention to news relating to the CFO or the vice president? What exactly do they do? Corporate governance is one of the main reasons that these terms exist. The evolution of public ownership has created a separation between ownership and management. Before the 20th century, many companies were small, family-owned and family-run. Today, many are large international conglomerates that trade publicly on one or many global exchanges. In an attempt to create a corporation in which stockholders' interests are looked after, many firms have implemented a two-tier corporate hierarchy. On the first tier is the board of governors or directors: these individuals are elected by the shareholders of the corporation. The most common corporate structure in the United States consists of a board of directors and the management team. Boards of directors most often include inside directors, who work day-to-day at the company, and outside directors, who can make impartial judgments. The top of most management teams has at least a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and a Chief Operations Officer (COO). On the second tier is the upper management: these individuals are hired by the board of directors. Let's begin by taking a closer look at the board of directors and what its members do. Please note that this corporate structure is what's common in the U.S.; in other countries, corporate structure might be slightly different. Understanding the Basics of Corporate Structure: Board of Directors: Elected by the shareholders, the board of directors is made up of two types of representatives. The first type involves inside directors chosen from within the company. This can be a CEO, CFO, manager, or any other person who works for the company daily. The other type of representative encompasses outside directors, chosen externally and considered independent of the company. The role of the board is to monitor a corporation's management team, acting as an advocate for stockholders. In essence, the board of directors tries to make sure that shareholders' interests are well served. Board members can be divided into three categories:  Chair: Technically the leader of the corporation, the board chair is responsible for running the board smoothly and effectively. Their duties typically include maintaining strong communication with the chief executive officer and high-level executives, formulating the company's business strategy, representing management and the board to the general public and shareholders, and maintaining corporate integrity. The chair is elected from the board of directors. Inside directors: These directors are responsible for approving high-level budgets prepared by upper management, implementing and monitoring business strategy, and approving core corporate initiatives and projects. Inside directors are either shareholders or high-level managers from within the company. Outside directors: While having the same responsibilities as the inside directors in determining strategic direction and corporate policy, outside directors are different in that they are not directly part of the management team. The purpose of having outside directors is to provide unbiased perspectives on issues brought to the board.",

Chief Executive Officer (CEO): As the top manager, the CEO is typically responsible for the corporation's entire operations and reports directly to the chair and the board of directors. It is the CEO's responsibility to implement board decisions and initiatives, as well as to maintain the smooth operation of the firm with senior management's assistance.  Often, the CEO will also be designated as the company's president and therefore be one of the inside directors on the board (if not the chair). Chief Operations Officer (COO): Responsible for the corporation's operations, the COO looks after issues related to marketing, sales, production, and personnel. Often more hands-on than the CEO, the COO looks after day-to-day activities while providing feedback to the CEO. The COO is often referred to as a senior vice president. Chief Financial Officer (CFO): Also reporting directly to the CEO, the CFO is responsible for analyzing and reviewing financial data, reporting financial performance, preparing budgets, and monitoring expenditures and costs. The CFO is required to present this information to the board of directors at regular intervals and provide it to shareholders and regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Together, management and the board of directors have the ultimate goal of maximizing shareholder value. In theory, management looks after the day-to-day operations, and the board ensures that shareholders are adequately represented. But the reality is that many boards include members of the management team. When you are researching a company, it's always a good idea to see if there is a good balance between internal and external board members. Other good signs are the separation of CEO and chair roles and a variety of professional expertise on the board from accountants, lawyers and executives.",

Antimicrobial resistance could become the world's leading cause of death, causing 10 million deaths per year by 2050 due to the lack of resources. Nearly 90 percent of these deaths are expected to occur in Asia and Africa. The rational use of antibiotics is therefore essential and requires a robust assessment of the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics. In industrialized countries, the identification of antibiotic resistance is facilitated by the use of automated systems for reading and interpreting antibiotic susceptibility tests. In developing countries, the identification of antibiotic resistance is much more difficult, which was evident when MSF set up bacteriology laboratories in five countries with limited resources.  The application created works without an internet connection, which is essential for use in low-resource countries. It takes pictures of the antibiogram with the phone's camera and guides the user during the analysis. It can interact at any time with the interface of the application to check and possibly correct the automatic measurements if necessary.    The ambition is to use the mobile application to adapt to the resource-constrained environments where MSF works. It would provide quality antibiotic susceptibility assessment for all patients worldwide, and it could contribute to the global effort to monitor antibiotic resistance.",

Natural Language Processing: Natural language processing can analyze patients’ records for further information processing. Rule-based Expert Systems: Expert systems work on multiple collections of ‘if-then’ rules. Many Electronic Health Record (EHR) providers use these rule sets within their systems. However, their application is limited to a point where it is accurate and easy to understand. This is because when the number of rules is high, the rules begin to conflict, leading to inaccuracies. As a result, these systems are slowly being replaced by more data-based approaches and machine-learning algorithms.

Safety and Transparency: Safety is one of the pressing concerns in using AI for healthcare diagnosis and treatment. Professionals need to ensure these systems’ safety and reliability and be transparent about them to minimize harm. Algorithmic Fairness and Biases: An AI system is only as reliable and effective as it is trained (to interpret data and learn from it to perform a task with accuracy). Therefore AI makers should address this risk and minimize biases at every stage to ensure it doesn’t adversely impact the effectiveness of healthcare solutions. Data Privacy: Patients must have adequate information about the collection and processing of their data to adhere to the fundamental privacy rights of human beings. Outlook for Machine Learning in Health Care: Machine learning in health care is growing faster than people may realize. Changing lifestyles, increased life expectancy, and rising prevalence of diseases have contributed to the rising demand for better and more accurate healthcare solutions. For example, by 2024, 40 per cent of healthcare leaders will focus on investment in AI for better healthcare facilities. The Future of AI in Healthcare: The future of AI in healthcare is moving towards delivering truly proactive and predictive healthcare systems. But it’s a long and complex journey that requires multiple stakeholders such as governments, technology companies, and healthcare providers to work in sync. In addition, as AI penetrates deeper, there will also be the need for increased security and the establishment of global standards to protect how AI uses data."

                            "The chapter begins by explaining how inflation needs to be in your considerations of not just your end investment successes , but in choosing an investment vehicle that performs best in a given inflationary circumstance. He makes note that, once again, the investor is able to make use of past data to position his assets in a way that will compliment inflation. Graham focuses immediately on the concepts that inflation will be felt most with portfolios that focus on fixed dollar income rather than ones that vary with the market. Essentially stating that high-quality common stocks have typically been able to better accommodate desired returns during periods of high-inflation. He’s comparing this to bond yields that would typically be eaten up by inflation. He admits though that stocks may perform better than bonds",
                            
                            "4. Steer clear of the herd: The herd mentality is what drives an investor to buy a stock just because a lot of others are, or to sell their holding simply because the general market is doing that. However, this is not the right way to buy or sell your holdings. As the book clearly suggests, “The stock investor is neither right or wrong because others agreed or disagreed with him; he is right because his facts and analysis are right.”  So, stop relying on the herd and start focusing on facts and analysis. This will help you make informed investment decisions rather than merely selling or buying based on what the majority is doing.   5. The past matters — but not too much: If that sounds a bit self-contradictory to you, take a look at these two lines from the book: Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it. The heart of Graham’s argument is that the intelligent investor must never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past. The first lesson here is that you need to keep your past mistakes in mind, so you don’t repeat them in your future investments and trades. Similarly, you also need to keep track of the practices that worked in your favour, so you can adopt these best practices in the future. The other lesson here is that the historical data of the market does have some relevance, but you cannot simply extrapolate it and assume the future will play out just like the past did. In other words, relying too much on historical data could be a costly mistake. At the same time, ignoring past data entirely is also not a favourable practice.

Understand the value of the business you are investing in: One quote from the book goes — “A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value that does not depend on its share price.” What this essentially means is that the stock you wish to invest in is not merely an asset listed on the exchange. There is an actual business behind it, and if you are a long-term investor, you need to understand how much value that business has. Is it worth the market price it trades at today, or is it overvalued? Does the company’s business have any potential for growth in the future? The questions will help you understand how your investment could appreciate or depreciate over the long term. And if you make your investment based on this kind of evaluation rather than guesswork, you could be a more successful investor. 2. Make investments objectively: Be aware of why you are investing in a particular stock. Benjamin Graham drives home this point by drawing a fine line between investors and speculators. To quote his observation from the book — “People who invest make money for themselves; people who speculate make money for their brokers.” Speculation carries a high degree of risk, and consequently, the possibility and the quantity of loss are higher. But if you want to invest intelligently over the long term, you need to put your money on an asset objectively, knowing why you are choosing it. Otherwise, your money will only go towards paying your brokerage. And your capital will only be eroded over time.  3. Prioritise research over impulses: A great many investors tend to buy or sell on an impulse. If you’ve been guilty of this habit too, it may be time to turn things around. Focus on research and analysis. If you are investing for the short term, technical analysis is your best friend. But if you are a long term investor, you need to perform fundamental analysis of your preferred stocks. This will help you stop focusing on what your stock market game is all about. As Benjamin Graham quotes in his book, “Investing isn’t about beating others at their game. It’s about controlling yourself at your own game.”",

Remember, Graham's philosophy was first and foremost to preserve capital, and then to try to make it grow. He suggested having 25% to 75% of your investments in bonds and varying this based on market conditions. This strategy had the added advantage of keeping investors from boredom, which leads to the temptation to participate in unprofitable trading (i.e., speculating).",

According to Boden, if you have the choice, it’s always best to purchase the new house first. For example, let’s say you don’t have any debt. Technically speaking, your debt-to-income ratio would then be 0% — plenty of room left for a mortgage payment. But if you take out a car loan with a $500 monthly payment and your income is only $1,000 per month, then you’re now at a debt-to-income ratio of 50%, which puts you above the limit for most mortgage programs. How Does Buying a House First Affect Your Car Loan? So, buying a car before a house isn’t the greatest idea, if you can help it. But what about the other way around? Does buying a house first then harm your chances of getting a car loan with good interest rates and reasonable car payments? “It likely wouldn’t matter on the car financing side because they’re not nearly as concerned with debt ratios like we are in the mortgage space,” says Bodan. “But this is honestly such a bad move for most homebuyers that the idea of a client buying a vehicle during the homebuying process is a running meme.” Still, even though your car loan lender might not be as concerned about your debt-to-income ratio as your mortgage lender, your car loan can still affect your personal finances in other ways. Ideally Mortgage First, Car Loan Later: If you have the option, the ideal sequence is this: buy a home first, wait a few months while you adjust to the new payments, and then take out a car loan, personal loan, or whatever other credit you need. It can be a pain to not have a car for a little while, but it’s a sacrifice that’s well worth it if you have the option as a borrower. But not everybody can do that. If you do need to buy a car and a house at the same time, know this: qualifying for a mortgage will be more difficult. If you have a good-sized down payment and little or no other debt, it’ll be easier for you to manage. If you do need to buy a house and a car at the same time, make sure you’ve discussed this with your mortgage lender and your real estate agent. Keep them in the loop about your car-buying progress so that they know what to expect. This will help speed your home buying process along as smoothly as possible.

To illustrate this, he made clear distinctions among various groups operating in the stock market. Active vs. Passive Investors: Graham referred to active and passive investors as 'enterprising investors' and 'defensive investors.' You only have two real choices: The first choice is to make a serious commitment in time and energy to become a good investor who equates the quality and amount of hands-on research with the expected return. If this isn't your cup of tea, then be content to get a passive (possibly lower) return, but with much less time and work. Graham turned the academic notion of 'risk = return' on its head. For him, 'work = return.' The more work you put into your investments, the higher your return should be. If you have neither the time nor the inclination to do quality research on your investments, then investing in an index is a good alternative. Graham said that the defensive investor could get an average return by simply buying the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in equal amounts. Both Graham and Buffett have said that getting even an average return, such as the return of the S&P 500, is more of an accomplishment than it might seem. The fallacy that many people buy into, according to Graham, is that if it's so easy to get an average return with little or no work (through indexing), then just a little more work should yield a slightly higher return. The reality is that most people who try this end up doing much worse than average. In modern terms, the defensive investor would be an investor in index funds of both stocks and bonds. In essence, they own the entire market, benefiting from the areas that perform the best without trying to predict those areas ahead of time. In doing so, an investor is virtually guaranteed the market's return and avoids doing worse than average by just letting the stock market's overall results dictate long-term returns. According to Graham, beating the market is much easier said than done, and many investors will find they don't beat the market. Speculator vs. Investor: Not all people in the stock market are investors. Graham believed that it was critical for people to determine whether they were investors or speculators. The difference is simple: An investor looks at a stock as part of a business and the stockholder as the owner of the business, while the speculator views himself as playing with expensive pieces of paper, with no intrinsic value. For the speculator, value is only determined by what someone will pay for the asset. To paraphrase Graham, there is intelligent speculating as well as intelligent investing; the key is to be sure you understand which you are good at.",

Do not fall for this; make sure you do your research. From Intelligent investor (and investopedia) Benjamin Graham is considered the father of 'value investing,' looking for stocks that are undervalued and holding them until they reach a valuation more in line with the stock's fundamentals. At the same time, he is also ready to sell a stock if it becomes overvalued relative to its fundamental metrics such as earnings multiple, EPS, and book value, to name a few. Graham cautions his readers to know what kind of trader they are before they enter the market. He offers two paradigms for investors: active vs. passive investors. So-called active investors spend a great deal of time and energy researching stocks they have identified as potential investments. Passive investors instead are more likely to buy indexes through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and take the market return on the investment. For Graham and Buffet, meeting the market rate of return is perfectly acceptable, while trying to beat the market is highly unlikely.",

The sooner you start, the better “Start early. If you don't know the power of compounding returns, learn it, because it will make you excited about your future.” Tara Unverzagt, CFP and founder of South Bay Financial Partners in Torrance, California. Investing allows your money to grow instead of sitting idle. When you invest, any returns you earn are added to your balance, and future returns are then based on that bigger balance. For example, if you invested $10,000 and earned a 6% average annual return on your investment, you’d have over $18,000 after 10 years. Give that money 30 years to grow instead and you’d have over $60,000. The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to accumulate wealth. Use our compound interest calculator to see how much your investment could grow over time. 3. Create a financial plan: “Have a plan. Period. If you can plan yourself, great. If you need to hire someone to hold you accountable, great. Financial planning is not just for retirees. I would argue it’s more important early in your life and career.” — Taylor S. Venanzi, CFP and founder of Activate Wealth, LLC in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Choosing investments can feel overwhelming — even deciding what kind of investment account to use can be complex. Doing some financial planning upfront creates a roadmap for your financial future. By outlining your financial goals, your timeline and your risk tolerance, you make it easier to answer some of those tricky investment questions.  Part of your financial plan should include whether you’re willing to manage your investments yourself or if you want help. Financial planning can be expensive, but options like robo-advisors and online financial planning services have driven costs down. Some robo-advisors offer investment management for as little as 0.25% of your account balance.  4. Don’t try to predict the market: “The temptation to pick out certain sectors in the market can be strong. It's better to get into diversified, low-cost funds.” — Wakefield Hare, CFP and founder of Greater Than Financial in Kansas City, Missouri.  Even for a professional, attempting to predict the market is challenging. Doing so with an elementary understanding is extremely risky. Instead of investing in a single stock or industry, a total-market index fund will give you exposure to multiple stocks, which helps diversify your portfolio and lowers your risk. Since index funds are passively managed — they track a benchmark index, like the S&P 500 — fees tend to be lower than actively managed funds."

In the first stage, it’s all about validating that the problem you’re solving is genuine and worth solving. Do customers actually need a solution? Would they pay for it? Once you validate that, you can proceed to the most important stage, finding the product/market fit for your lean startup. In this stage, you must validate your MVP and your business model. Before it, you will have gone through several “build, measure, learn” cycles. Your product will actually be solving the customers’ problem, and you’ll already be making some revenue. After you see that your startup is operational, there is a need for your product in the market, and that customers are using it, it’s time to scale and grow. You’ll need to secure funds, use data to identify the best marketing and sales channels, and constantly work on further improving your product. To learn is to grow, after all. The Pivot is where we change our old hypothesis to create a new one. We find a new Minimum Viable Product and try to prove that this new hypothesis is true.

Entrepreneurs are everywhere:  If you have a startup, you’re an entrepreneur who can apply lean startup methodology. It doesn’t matter if you work in your bedroom, your garage, or dedicated office space. And it doesn’t matter what the size of your startup is. If you want to save time and resources and lean startup methodology sounds like something that might be up your alley, then do it. 2. Entrepreneurship is a management: Just like any other company, startups need management — though it might not look like traditional management. This means that processes will not be as orderly or protocol-based as they would in a company with an established and operational business model. Managers should be able to react in risky situations, to manage investors, and to allow employees to experiment as long as the risks are deemed acceptable.  3. Validated learning: Lean startups are all about building a sustainable business model through validated learning. This means conducting the aforementioned experiments, getting results, and basing all future decisions on relevant data. Does your product solve a problem in the market? If not, how can you pivot and adapt? 4. Innovation accounting: To successfully create a sustainable business, entrepreneurs have to be capable of monitoring progress objectively, setting up milestones, prioritizing work, and making the right decisions based on what the data shows is appropriate. 5. Build, measure, learn: The “build, measure, learn” loop enables validated learning through the famous minimum viable product (MVP) on which the experiments are conducted.

Intellectual property laws: The term “intellectual property” relates to intangible property such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) oversees domestic and international intellectual property protection for U.S. companies.  Trademarks,  Patents,  Patents protect the rights of inventors. They give the patent owner the right to stop others from making, using, or selling an invention. Patents usually last 20 years from the date the patent application was filed. There are three types of patents you can apply for: utility patents, design patents, and plant patents. 2. Business tax laws: It’s important to understand these laws and consult with professionals so you can try to avoid audits and hefty fees. Income tax, Employment tax: if your business has employees, you must pay all taxes associated with employing them. These taxes include Social Security and Medicare taxes and Federal unemployment (FUTA) tax. Employers are also responsible for withholding federal income tax from their employees’ wages. Other taxes may apply. Excise tax: Excise tax comes into play when you manufacture or sell specific products, operate certain kinds of businesses (such as businesses with trucks and/or tractors), use various kinds of equipment, facilities, or products, and/or receive payment for certain services. 3. Employment laws: Employment laws, or labor laws, are the general set of rules that apply to businesses that have workers. These laws cover the rights and responsibilities between employers and workers and are governed by both state and federal law.

It allows small businesses that employ 1–50 employees to offer affordable health and/or dental care to their employees. SHOP plans allow for lower premium costs. Learn more about your responsibilities as a business owner under the ACA. 5. Advertising laws: If you’re thinking about advertising on the internet or in print, there are rules and guidelines to protect businesses and consumers — and help maintain the credibility of those advertising media. The laws work to prevent acts or practices in advertising that might deceive or be unfair to consumers. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the governing body that enforces these laws and enacts rules. 6. Privacy laws: It’s important to maintain the privacy of your customers and the Federal Trade Commission also enforces laws that protect consumer privacy. Consumers and employees care about the privacy of their personal information, and it’s critical that you’re clearly communicating how you use their data. This includes everything from storing and sharing email addresses to protecting payment info. 7. Finance laws: As a business, you must follow finance laws.

Workload: Many managers have too heavy of a workload and are forced to balance both justice tasks and other, technical tasks that support the company’s core functions. When under high demands and time pressure, justice tasks, on average, tended to be pushed aside more.   Rewards: Companies explicitly and implicitly reward technical tasks over justice tasks. This permeates corporate rhetoric on many levels – from what is mentioned in job descriptions to promotions. When companies’ rewards systems emphasize technical tasks as more important than justice tasks, the latter tends to slip through the cracks more when workloads are higher. Sherf and his colleagues reached several conclusions. Workload, the prioritization of technical tasks and low-justice rewards play a defining role in whether managers engage in justice behaviors required for employees to feel fairly treated.      Companies that produce a context of “high-workload low-justice rewards” for their managers create an environment in which managers tend to neglect justice behaviors more. If justice behaviors are seen as more important (even as equally important as technical tasks), managers can achieve similar task performance while also finding ways to devote time to justice behaviors. A “how to” on fairness: “Fairness does not occur in a vacuum,” Sherf says. “Companies need to be aware of how their managers’ workloads and job descriptions – as well as the organizations’ systems of rewards –influence fairness.” For lower-level managers: Be deliberate, but creative with your time. Think whether your time management approach affords time for justice tasks, not only technical ones. Ensure that you are anchoring time for justice in ways that are not easily prioritized in real-time. That is, don’t leave it to chance or to “if I will have the time.”  For upper-level managers:    Listen to managers and, when possible, provide the flexibility they need to order their workdays in ways that best allows them to complete both justice and technical tasks.

This might be in the form of merit pay increases or variable pay programs. Paying employees in proportion the value they generate, say $40 an hour, helps create a sense of ownership in the employee and incentivizes them to continue to be productive. Do not just pay a flat salary for all workers in a certain position, then they have no incentive to work harder.",

Write an executive summary: This is the first page of your business plan. Think of it as your elevator pitch. It should include a mission statement, a brief description of the products or services offered, and a broad summary of your financial growth plans.  2. Describe your company: Next up is your company description, which should contain information like: Your business’s registered name.  Address of your business location.   Names of key people in the business. Make sure to highlight unique skills or technical expertise among members of your team.   Your company description should also define your business structure — such as a sole proprietorship, partnership or corporation — and include the percent ownership that each owner has and the extent of each owner’s involvement in the company.  3. State your business goals: The third part of a business plan is an objective statement. This section spells out exactly what you’d like to accomplish, both in the near term and over the long term. 4. Describe your products and services: In this section, go into detail about the products or services you offer or plan to offer. You should include the following:   An explanation of how your product or service works.     The pricing model for your product or service.  The typical customers you serve.     Your supply chain and order fulfillment strategy.   Your sales strategy.   Your distribution strategy.   You can also discuss current or pending trademarks and patents associated with your product or service.   5. Do your market research: Lenders and investors will want to know what sets your product apart from your competition. In your market analysis section, explain who your competitors are. Discuss what they do well, and point out what you can do better. If you’re serving a different or underserved market, explain that.",

Outline your marketing and sales plan:  Here, you can address how you plan to persuade customers to buy your products or services, or how you will develop customer loyalty that will lead to repeat business.  7. Perform a business financial analysis: If you’re a startup, you may not have much information on your business financials yet. However, if you’re an existing business, you’ll want to include income or profit-and-loss statements, a balance sheet that lists your assets and debts, and a cash flow statement that shows how cash comes into and goes out of the company. You may also include metrics such as: Net profit margin: the percentage of revenue you keep as net income. Current ratio: the measurement of your liquidity and ability to repay debts.  Accounts receivable turnover ratio: a measurement of how frequently you collect on receivables per year.   This is a great place to include charts and graphs that make it easy for those reading your plan to understand the financial health of your business. 8. Make financial projections: This is a critical part of your business plan if you’re seeking financing or investors. It outlines how your business will generate enough profit to repay the loan or how you will earn a decent return for investors.  Here, you’ll provide your business’s monthly or quarterly sales, expenses and profit estimates over at least a three-year period — with the future numbers assuming you’ve obtained a new loan. 9. Add additional information to an appendix:  List any supporting information or additional materials that you couldn’t fit in elsewhere, such as resumes of key employees, licenses, equipment leases, permits, patents, receipts, bank statements, contracts and personal and business credit history. If the appendix is long, you may want to consider adding a table of contents at the beginning of this section.",
                            
                            "It’s not unusual for entrepreneurs to work two jobs at the same time, at least during the launch phase of their startup. They have their full-time job, which provides reliable income and helps pay the bills. And they have their startup job, at which they work hard for little or no pay as they try to grow the company. 1. Does your job allow it? The first thing to determine is whether your job allows you to run a business on the side. 2. Don’t compete with your employer: It may be obvious to some, but do not run a side business that competes directly or indirectly with your employer. It’s not ethical, will affect your reputation permanently, and could have serious legal consequences. If you plan to run a company that will compete against your current employer, the right thing to do is resign. 3. Run your business outside of company hours: Run your business during your own time, without exception. This approach is the only way to run a company while being fair to your employer. It’s that simple. While at work, give your employer 100% of your attention. Keep in mind that your job still pays your bills, and the last thing you want to do is put your income at risk. 4. Try to get out as quickly as possible. Juggling a business on the side and working a full-time job is difficult and can’t be done for long. It’s too demanding, especially as your company starts growing. You will either burnout or reach a point where you are so busy that you can’t give your employer the attention they deserve and pay for. 5. Know when to quit: Knowing when to quit and focus on your startup full time requires careful consideration. Leaving the safety of a steady paycheck and a structured office is not easy. Quit too soon and you will set yourself up for failure. Wait too long to quit, and your startup will miss opportunities. If you have sufficient savings, quit once your business is making money and is on track to replace your salary in the near future. 6. Keep it private: Don’t make the mistake of telling everyone in your company that you are running a startup. This creates tension, and might get you fired."

                            " What were the key AI developments in 2022? First came DALL-E, the AI that can create pictures from language prompts. Many of us enjoyed playing with the tool and embracing the ability it gave to us to design in new ways. Others worried about AI taking over our human creativity. Moreover, since DALL-E pulls photos from the web, there is concern that some cultures with little online representation will be left out of these models and will become less represented in the world. Next there was ChatGPT, DALL-E’s literate and coder “sibling”. Whilst the former creates new images the latter creates text and code. These texts can be newspaper articles, students’ essays, speeches, scientific papers and more. Again, it does so from a written prompt provided by the users. The concerns that surround DALL-E also surround ChatGPT, it is a “black box” so we have no understanding of how it works. But there is no doubt that if ChatGPT improves efficiency and if it is used in the right way, it will be a hugely important tool. Furthermore, the AI development company DeepMind created an algorithm which codes very well. The system, AlphaCode can beat 72% of human coders in average competitions and recently solved about 30% of the coding problems in a highly complex coding competition against humans. Whilst this figure may seem low, this algorithm will learn exponentially – think AlphaGo which now can beat every human GO player. It is unlikely that AI will take over programming completely, but it will cut the number of humans needed to code dramatically. If all the above are extraordinary, and they are, the arrival of Gato is the icing on the cake. Gato, which is described as a generalist agent by inventors DeepMind, is an important development because whereas currently powerful algorithms do one or two things exceedingly well, Gato can do many. This includes playing Atari, titling images, chatting with users, stacking blocks using a robotic arm and more. This development moves us away from narrow, one task, AI and into the realm of an AI being able to do multiple tasks.",
                            
                            "1. Patient Risk Identification: With traditional patient risk identification techniques, it was found that the number of different combinations of variables about conditions, lab values, socioeconomic information, and other data points corresponding to individuals made it very challenging to identify the relationship among the data points. Machine learning models can address some of the weaknesses of traditional linear models as they are better at handling nonlinearity and can better identify implicit relationships among the input variables. Machine learning models can handle feature selection, which is a process that is used to determine the variables and relationships to be considered while building the model. Hence, machine learning algorithms can be used to identify high-risk patients based on historical data, assuming a high number of variables and data points. Machine Learning Project Idea for Practice: Heart Disease Prediction Project Using Machine Learning:  A stroke occurs due to some brain cells’ sudden death due to a lack of oxygen supply to the brain. Oxygen supply is affected when the blood cannot flow to the brain either because of a blockage or rupturing of an artery connected to the brain. The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks stroke as the second leading cause of death globally. Early prognosis of signs of stroke and stroke diseases can help high-risk patients make lifestyle changes. This project aims to analyze the factors that can be classified as “high-risk” for stroke and the relationship between them. You can use the method of logistic regression to identify various factors. 2. Pattern Imaging Analytics: Machine learning techniques find applications in radiology to help doctors identify any subtle changes in scans that can be missed by the human eye to diagnose health issues at early stages. Scientists have developed deep learning models by training them on previously captured radiographic images to identify the early development of tumors in the brain, lungs, breasts, and other organs. The algorithms are trained to recognize complex patterns in radiographic images. Machine learning tools help radiologists improve their patient care, making them better at their jobs while not replacing them. The use of pattern recognition and segmentation techniques on images such as retinal scans, bones, internal organs, and pathology slides enable faster diagnoses and better tracking of disease progression.

Maintaining Healthcare Records: Machine learning techniques can simplify the maintenance of healthcare records, especially electronic health records (EHRs). Using artificial intelligence methods in EHR management can help improve patient care and optimize operations. For example, natural language processing can capture and record a physician’s note and eliminate the manual process. In EHR management systems, machine learning can make it easier to provide clinical decision support, automated image analysis, and integrate telehealth technologies. To effectively apply machine learning techniques to healthcare records, healthcare informatics professionals must maintain data integrity by classifying and cleansing the data. 6. Personalized Treatment: All bodies are not clinically similar, and hence individuals react to medical treatments differently. Personalized medicine requires a customized approach to ensure the health of a particular individual, which will vary from another individual with similar health conditions. Usage of machine learning algorithms opens up the possibility of finding medicines specifically tailored for an individual based on clinical, laboratory, genetics, nutrition, geography, and lifestyle-related data. Multi-modal data can perform a deeper analysis of large datasets and significantly improve human health understanding. 7. Robotic Surgery: Though robotics in surgery has been around for a while, it is only recently getting integrated with machine learning and artificial intelligence. Machine learning is currently being integrated into robotic surgery for some purposes, such as the automation of suturing and improving surgical materials. Machine learning is also being used as an evaluation tool to monitor the surgical skills of doctors. Some surgeries, especially neurosurgeries, require a sensitive approach and also go on for long durations. Even the best of surgeons can end up fumbling. Since it is a matter of life and death, training robots to perform the surgeries is likely to guarantee more precision. 8. Improved Radiotherapy: Machine learning has shown immense improvements in the field of radiology. Medical image analysis involves multiple discrete variables that can be analyzed more efficiently with machine learning. Machine learning-based algorithms can learn from many disparate data samples and can hence better identify the relevant variables.

A customer support bot: One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on NLP projects for students is working on customer support bot. A conventional chatbot answers basic customer queries and routine requests with canned responses. But these bots cannot recognize more nuanced questions. So, support bots are now equipped with artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to overcome these limitations. In addition to understanding and comparing user inputs, they can generate answers to questions on their own without pre-written responses. For example, Reply.ai has built a custom ML-powered bot to provide customer support. According to the company, an average organization can take care of almost 40 % of its inbound support requests with their tool. Now, let us describe the model required to implement a project inspired by this product. 2. A language identifier: Have you noticed that Google Chrome can detect which language in which a web page is written? It can do so by using a language identifier based on a neural network model. This is an excellent NLP projects for beginners. The process of determining the language of a particular body of text involves rummaging through different dialects, slangs, common words between different languages, and the use of multiple languages in one page. But with machine learning, this task becomes a lot simpler. 3. An ML-powered autocomplete feature: Autocomplete typically functions via the key value lookup, wherein the incomplete terms entered by the user are compared to a dictionary to suggest possible options of words. This feature can be taken up a notch with machine learning by predicting the next words or phrases in your message. Here, the model will be trained on user inputs instead of referencing a static dictionary. A prime example of an ML-based autocomplete is Gmail’s ‘Smart Reply’ option, which generates relevant replies to your emails. Now, let us see how you can build such a feature. 4. A predictive text generator: This is one of the interesting NLP projects. Have you ever heard of the game AI Dungeon 2? It is a classic example of a text adventure game built using the GPT-2 prediction model. The game is trained on an archive of interactive fiction and demonstrates the wonders of auto-generated text by coming up with open-ended storylines. Although machine learning in the area of game development is still at a nascent stage, it is set to transform experiences in the near future. Learn how python performs in game development. 5. A media monitor: One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on NLP projects for students is working on media monitor. In the modern business environment, user opinion is a crucial denominator of your brand’s success. Customers can openly share how they feel about your products on social media and other digital platforms. Therefore, today’s businesses want to track online mentions of their brand. The most significant fillip to these monitoring efforts has come from the use of machine learning.",

Spatio-Temporal 3D Reconstruction from Multiple Videos: Considering a dynamic scene that changes over time, 3D reconstruction can be applied to every time step independently. However, one can achieve temporally more consistent results by using the information from several time frames together, thus computing a spatio-temporal hyper-surface in 4D space. 3D Reconstruction from a Single View: The estimation of 3D geometry from a single image is a special case of image-based 3D reconstruction from several images, but is considerably more difficult since depth cannot be estimated from pixel correspondences. Thus, further prior knowledge or user input is needed in order to recover or infer any depth information. Optical Flow Estimation: Estimating the motion of every pixel in a sequence of images is a problem with many applications in computer vision, such as image segmentation, object classification,visual odometry, and driver assistance. Shape Analysis: Robot Vision: We develop computer vision methods for robot systems such as micro aerial vehicles and wheeled robots. In recent years, flying robots such as quadrocopters have gained increased interest in robotics and computer vision research. To navigate safely, these robots need the ability to localize themselves autonomously using their onboard sensors. Image Segmentation: Image segmentation aims at partitioning an image into n disjoint regions. Since this problem is highly ambiguous additional information is indispensible. This can be given as user input, e.g. scribbles on the image, additional constraints such as the center of gravity and the major axes of the object or learned from a given database.   Marker-less Motion Capture: In this project, we develop statistical and energy minimization methods to tracking articulated 3D objects from multiple camera views. Such techniques are of central importance in particular for markerless motion capture. The human motion sequence extracted from multiple videos can subsequently be used to animate virtual characters as commonly done in action movies.",

The right conditions for the crop to grow, identifying the nutrient deficiencies in the soil, and enabling image recognition technology to improve the harvest quality are done by the use of AI applications in fields. Livestock management: As Artificial intelligence and machine learning have become easily available now, the use of applications pertaining to this technology has benefited the farmers greatly to manage their livestock efficiently. AI technology has revolutionized the farming by using applications like robots, drones and smart monitoring systems. Apart from this, technologies created to monitor the health of farm animals, to detect injuries and illness saves the time and effort of the farmer. Crop management: The applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are both utmost important in the field of agriculture. The applications of machine learning help the framers to do their core work more easily and stress free. The ML powered support vector machines help the farmers to supervise over the farms and is largely used in the rice fields to yield the quantity and making process. Species management:  Selecting the right species is not an easy task as it involves searching for the right species, regulating the nutrients used, adapting to climate change, checking for ability to stand diseases and a lot more. Here machine learning applications analyse the years of field data to help farmers in predicting the right genes according to the changing weather conditions. It also aids in quick and way more accurate results to classify the species by embedding morphology in its systems. In the recent years , the agriculture industry has begun to use AI and ML to increase productivity and it is expected to contribute another $2 to $3 trillion to the global GDP in the next few years while helping farmers to alleviate the current pressure due to the issue of food scarcity and also reducing the repercussion on the environment.

                            "On occasion, the media do appear to criticize the ruling elites of society. There are numerous cases, the Watergate scandal being a fine example, where politicians or business leaders are criticized by the media and their misdeeds exposed. Such incidents seem to disprove the idea of an inherent bias in the media toward the ruling classes. Certainly, media spokespeople do proudly proclaim that they act as the defenders of free speech and the wider community against the wealthy and powerful. Yet, in these cases, the mass media’s so-called criticism merely consists of representing the interests of one group of the elite against another, never of a non-elite group versus an elite group. When criticisms come from outside the elite, the media will suppress or ignore them. The Watergate scandal exemplified such a split in elite interests. The media were fully willing to investigate and pursue Richard Nixon and his accomplices, because the victims of their crime were the powerful Democrats, a political party who represented a section of the elite. When the Socialist Workers Party, a small party representing no elite interest, was illegally spied upon by government agencies, the media remained silent.

                            "The mass media heavily slant their coverage in favor of the interests and opinions of the elite. News which goes against these interests is deliberately ignored or suppressed. Unlike the media in authoritarian societies, the media in the democratic west are not constrained by state ownership or heavy censorship. The forces which coerce the western media are more subtle and ‘natural,’ leading many to falsely believe that the West has a ‘free’ and ‘objective’ press.   The pressures which compel the mass media to publish propaganda for the upper echelons of the social hierarchy can be best explained with a ‘propaganda model.’ The model contains various filters through which information must pass before it is ‘clean’ enough to become news. These filters can consist of financial incentives, such as the need to be profitable or to appease owners or advertisers. For example, the multinational company General Electric owns a huge section of the mass media. They are involved in the contentious areas of nuclear power and the arms trade, and therefore lean heavily on their media networks to stay clear of controversies in these areas. Other filters can be derived from the sources of the news and how news is presented. For example, because government agencies and large corporations provide a great deal of source material for the news, the media may come to rely on those sources heavily. Those sources could therefore exert control of the media by feeding them carefully selected news items framed in a certain light. These various filters ensure that any news which is actually presented in the media is staunchly in favor of those in power.",

This medium helped represent and spread working class views, seriously threatening the ruling class’s monopoly on information. What destroyed the radical press’s power was the free market. Only the right-wing press backed by the dominant elites remained, and it prospered. This process continued and the industry consolidated, leaving a few massive giants to dominate the entire media market of the Western world. Even today the mass media is owned and controlled by a few rich families and corporations whose sole goal is profit. The immense power they wield cannot be underestimated; the top 29 media providers account for over half of America’s newspapers and the vast majority of sales and audiences of magazines, movies, books and broadcasts. Independent media has very little chance of survival against this monopoly. Such control over the market makes the mass media an attractive industry to investors such as banks and brokers. In return for their capital, these investors expect the media to pursue profit through sales and advertising. These two forces – control by a tiny elite and the need to prioritize profits – severely hamper the objectivity of the mass media.",

Success in the marketplace depends overwhelmingly on the sponsorship of advertisers. Media organizations that lack advertising revenues are very likely to fail. Therefore, the main objective of media companies is the attraction of advertisers. To this end, the media will seek to please its advertisers through biased coverage. Thus, advertising becomes another filter in the propaganda model, allowing the wealthy to filter out critical news stories. There are many ways in which the mass media are obliged to alter their reports due to advertising pressure. The most obvious is the suppression of news which could potentially damage big business. In one case, a US TV network lost its advertising funding after showing a documentary highlighting the malpractice of multinationals in the Third World. In televised media, advertisers will even go as far as to demand that programs with a serious outlook be removed from the schedule as they might interfere with the ‘buying mood’ of the viewer. Advertisers prefer light entertainment over hard-hitting documentaries and dramas. The overriding interest for advertisers is of course maximizing sales. To achieve this, corporations will coerce the media to target their content to the interests of wealthier audiences who will buy more products from advertisers. Media that appeals to poorer working class audiences will stand less chance of attracting money through advertising, and thus the scope of perspectives available in the media is narrowed.",

Hence, they must focus on sources which provide material constantly. Such sources are overwhelmingly state institutions, such as the police and government agencies, or the press departments of large corporations. The reasons the media use these sources are obvious. Their sheer size enables them to provide regular material, and in addition they are regarded as reliable and objective, meaning that the media are able to treat information as fact without the expense of having to check it. But the overreliance on these bodies enables the ruling elites to control and ‘manage’ the media, adding another filter to the propaganda model that determines what news is allowed to trickle through to the masses. The dominance of the government and big businesses in providing information allows them to set the news agenda. They can feed the media with stories at the optimum times in order to boost their position. For example, in 1984 the media released a carefully-timed false story about the supply of Soviet MiG aircraft to Nicaragua. The story helped stir up alarm in the United States and discredit the Nicaraguan election, thus helping President Reagan’s political agenda. Alternative sources of information are at a distinct disadvantage, because the news they provide is sporadic and open to criticism, especially if that information is contrary to elite interests. The media may even be under pressure to suppress alternative views for fear of upsetting their regular sources.",

The criticism thrown back at the media by the elite is known as ‘flak.’ Flak can take various forms: Journalists and media outlets can be directly threatened by the government or corporations, becoming the target of negative press releases. The elite can also create flak indirectly, leaning on advertisers to boycott certain media companies. Sometimes even legal action is taken against critical media. The aim of flak is to put free-thinking media on the defensive, fostering an image of an unfairly critical media with a ‘liberal bias.’ Well-directed and funded flak generates fear in media companies, creating another important filter in the propaganda model. The ruling elites can generate flak through right-wing ‘think tanks’ whose sole role is to target the critical media with flak. These organizations are often prestigious, powerful and richly funded by the elite, so when they say the media is being unfairly critical, people tend to listen. A good example of the power of flak is the dossier published by the right-wing think tank ‘Freedom House’ on the media’s role in the Vietnam War. This document claimed the media were too pessimistic in their reporting of various campaigns in the war, and it even accused the mass media of having cost the United States the war by misleading the American public through this reporting. The dossier was well received amongst the elite and reported on positively in the mass media despite research inaccuracies and exaggerated conclusions.",

However, they rarely face scrutiny by the media, except when their fellow journalist was assassinated. The mass media like to proclaim that their coverage is objective, but if this were the case they would report events in the same way irrespective of where in the world they happened. Looking at the media’s coverage of events, it is clear that this is not so, as they slant news stories differently depending on the political situation of those involved. A perfect example of this is the mass media coverage of the issues concerning Central America. The nations in this area lie within the sphere of American influence and are therefore of interest to the US government and mass media.  Some nations, such as Guatemala and El Salvador, are US-sponsored military dictatorships. Others, such as bourgeoning democracy Nicaragua, are left-leaning and are therefore mistrusted by US authorities. The media slant their coverage of events from these nations depending on their friendliness to elite interests in the US, often completely reversing the actual truth if deemed convenient.",

The story was covered at great length in the US media with the emphasis on its emotional impact and its wider political implications for the communist system.  This story is perfect for the media, because it fits into the framework created by the interests of the ruling elites: It casts the communist enemy as a brutal and dangerous force which in turn helps gather support for American policies. Compare this with the media’s lack of coverage of the torture and murder of hundreds of religious representatives in Central American states friendly to the US. There are countless examples of how priests who stand against the autocratic governments in those states face vicious and violent oppression, yet the media remains largely silent.  By comparing the coverage devoted to each case, it would appear that the life of a priest murdered in Poland is worth one hundred times more than a priest murdered in Central America. The reason is obvious. The media must gleefully report wrongdoings in enemy nations, using lurid details to raise anger amongst viewers and readers, while linking the crimes directly to the ruling system. With US allies, on the other hand, the media keep state crimes hidden to preserve unity; even going as far as to conceal the murder of US citizens in Central America. They are considered victims unworthy of our attention, because they died in the wrong circumstances and at the hands of the wrong people (lifeclub.org)."

To put it simply, if you can’t effectively communicate your message to your team, you can never be a good leader. Words can get people motivated and make them do the unimaginable. If you are making effective use of them, you can also achieve better results. 2.Honesty and Integrity:  Honesty and Integrity are two main elements that make for a strong leader. How do you demand integrity from your supporters if you neglect such qualities? Leaders excel because they hold to their basic principles and convictions, and that won’t be possible without ethics. 3.Decision maker: A leader should be capable of making the right decision at the right time. Leaders take actions that have a huge effect on people. A leader should think long and hard before taking a decision but stand by it once the decision is made. 4.Must be able to inspire others:  Perhaps the toughest thing a leader to do is convince people to follow them. This will only be done by providing a clear example and encouraging your followers. We look up to them when the going gets tough and see how they. As a leader, you should think optimistically, and your positive attitude should be evident from your actions. A leader should keep cool under strain and retain a degree of encouragement. If you excel in inspiring your colleagues, you will comfortably resolve every obstacle now and in the future. 6.Has a vision and purpose: Influential leaders have intent and vision. Not only can they imagine the future, but they also express their dreams with their supporters. If their fans could see the larger picture, they could understand where they are headed. A strong leader discusses why they are going towards the path that they are heading and reveals the approach and course of action to accomplish the purpose.",

They also lack empathy, which means that they are able to ruthlessly exploit and abuse people for the sake of power. Psychopaths feel a similar sense of superiority and lack of empathy, but without the same impulse for attention and adoration. But pathocracy isn’t just about individuals. As Lobaczewski pointed out, pathological leaders tend to attract other people with psychological disorders. At the same time, empathetic and fair-minded people gradually fall away. They are either ostracised or step aside voluntarily, appalled by the growing pathology around them. As a result, over time pathocracies become more entrenched and extreme. You can see this process in the Nazi takeover of the German government in the 1930s, when Germany moved from democracy to pathocracy in less than two years. Democracy is an essential way of protecting people from pathological politicians, with principles and institutions that limit their power (the Bill of Rights in the US, which guarantees certain rights to citizens is a good example). This is why pathocrats hate democracy. Once they attain power they do their best to dismantle and discredit democratic institutions, including the freedom and legitimacy of the press. This is the first thing that Hitler did when he became German chancellor, and it is what autocrats such as Trump, Vladimir Putin and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán have been attempting to do.",

Make sure to research candidates as the candidates with the most funding, often from corporations (aka lobbyists), and most likely to be corrupt. The mass media devote a great deal of attention to high-profile elections, but in American political life such elections are the exception, not the rule. The majority of electoral contests feature candidates who are relative unknowns. In such situations, does name recognition breed contempt, indifference, or affection? Existing work presents modest theory and mixed evidence. Using three laboratory experiments, we provide conclusive evidence that name recognition can affect candidate support, and we offer strong evidence that a key mechanism underlying this relationship is inferences about candidate viability. We further show that the name-recognition effect dissipates in the face of a more germane cue, incumbency. We conclude with a field study that demonstrates the robustness of the name-recognition effect to a real-world political context, that of yard signs and a county election. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259546523_Name_Recognition_and_Candidate_Support",

The Republican House speaker called the protest a publicity stunt. Whatever the issue might be, this chaos in Washington left us wondering -- why is it so hard to pass a bill? Good Question. In the 1970s, Schoolhouse Rock taught kids about the challenges of turning a bill into law, but nowhere in the song does it talk about lobbyists or filibusters, and definitely not about sit-ins. 'Most bills introduced, die,' political analyst Larry Jacobs said. 'You can think of Congress, and here at the state level in Minnesota, as a graveyard.' Jacobs said more than 90 percent of bills introduced never go anywhere -- they get buried in committees and subcommittees, mostly due to what Jacobs calls bipartisan battering. 'The partisan virus started in Washington, but it's now spread all over the country,' Jacobs said. During this session of Congress, only 2 percent of bills introduced have become law. When legislation is introduced, it's put in a committee, and then it has to get a hearing. 'Only a very small number of bills that go to committees actually receive hearings and move through the process of being marked up and moved on,' Jacobs said. Special interest groups, foundations, and lobbyists can serve as traps and trip wires along the way. 'They are warning those lawmakers: If you vote for this, we are going to come back and defeat you in the next election. We are going to give money to the primary challenger,' Jacobs said. If a bill does move on, the House and Senate have to pass the same legislation before it can be signed. 'Even if Congress goes through that awful process and passes something, it goes to the President -- who may not like it -- and he can veto it,' Jacobs said. 'The next time you see the President signing something, just look to the sky and wonder what angel is looking down with a smile.'  Jacobs said the party in control of the House or Senate doesn't always get what it wants either. That's because quite often politicians who are in the same party can't agree on legislation. https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/good-question-passing-bills/",

Voting is more than just electing a candidate, it’s choosing the right policies and people who have your best interests in mind when making decisions that will affect our community, state and nation. When you vote, you are taking an active role in deciding issues regarding health care, immigration, equal opportunity, voting rights, infrastructure, jobs, education, social security, neighborhood safety, taxes, etc. 2. Vote to Allocate Federal Money To this Region. This money can be used for education, youth programs, healthcare, veterans, creating jobs, the environment, etc. In the Rio Grande Valley 4 out of 10 people vote in a Presidential Election and only 2 out of 10 vote in a Gubernatorial Election. This is not enough! For this region to grow and get state and federal funding, we need to vote. 3. If You Do Not Vote, Someone Else Will. Voting only takes a couple of minutes but the ripple effect caused by your vote will last beyond a candidate’s term. Do you want someone else deciding for you the laws that will affect your family and community? Voting gives you the power to choose how your city, state, and country will be run. If you don’t vote, you can’t complain! Go vote and make the decision before someone else does it for you. 4. Decide How Your Taxes Will Be Spent.  Elected officials such as county/city commissioners, the governor, state officials, legislators, President, and members of Congress will decide how to pay for public services with the money collected from our taxes and how to share the tax burden. Take an active role and find out if your candidate shares your views and will spend your money wisely. 5. Voting Affects Your Job.

The break room water cooler is a perfect spot for chit chat, but it’s not going to be the best place to quickly drum up union support. Instead, you’ll need a less-public approach when reaching out to your coworkers. Keep the union talk to after working hours and outside the office. You can grab lunch with your coworkers or send them a text after work. Don’t slide into just anyone’s DMs.  While you want to eventually reach out to as many people as possible, there are some coworkers you have to leave out of the conversation. Don’t talk to anyone in a leadership position, like managers, supervisors and directors about unionizing. Even if you think they’d support it, they can’t help you. Yeah, it’s another legal thing. Start with a few one-on-one conversations with coworkers who you’re close to and suspect may be interested in unionizing.   How to win friends and influence your workplace.  So, you’re ready to talk unions with Jim from Sales. What do you actually say? We’ve found it’s helpful if you spend more time listening to a coworker’s experiences than immediately leaping into why you need to unionize. For those who are unfamiliar with unions and what they can do, the whole thing can sound scary or unnecessary. A good way to kick off the conversation is simply by asking them how their week is going and if there’s anything they’d like to change in the workplace. You’ll get a better read on their views, their position towards management and their job. You’ll also get valuable information on what issues your union can eventually advocate for. If you’re getting good vibes from the conversation, shift it into drive and ask them if they’d like to team up and form a union. If it sounds like a coworker is supportive of management or anti-union, quickly change the subject to something more neutral. Remember: safety first. If we sound like an after-school special, we’re okay with that.",

Some of your coworkers might need more information. Rest assured, you don’t have to memorize everything there is to know about forming a union —  we already have. To prove it, we’ve assembled a Unionizing Guide that’s free and easy to access. Send it to your coworkers who have questions and are interested in learning more. If a coworker decides unions aren’t their thing, that’s okay. Rest easy knowing your union will ultimately benefit them anyway. Caring for each other is what it’s all about! Do you want to unionize? Y/N: After putting in the work and feeling kind of like a spy, you’ve done it: A good chunk of your coworkers are excited about unionizing. Time to make it official. Keep in touch with your coworkers and remind them to sign their election petition card and vote 'yes' to certify the union. Company leadership might try to discourage your unit, but stay the course. Your union is so close to pulling up a seat at the table and enacting meaningful change. And that’s the power of a few good conversations. (Unit Workers)",

Longer Hours Does Not Mean More Output: Supporters of shorter working weeks say that the current work environment is defined increasingly by long hours and the “always-on” mentality. “It’s not by running a sweatshop … it’s more about working smarter,” Diamondback’s CEO, Ben Eltz, told The Atlantic. Diamondback cut five hours of the work week when the pandemic started – but did not decrease pay. In Japan’s four-day work week trial, they found the experiment boosted productivity by 40%. Increased Mental Wellbeing and Physical Health: Workers who have been working fewer days a week report a number of positive side effects, from exercising more to finishing a Master’s program early to volunteering more to simply finding time to cope with the effects of the pandemic. This, in turn, has a net positive impact on a workers’ productivity at the office. “I like to take walks … just wander and let my brain breathe,” Natalie Nagele, the Wildbit CEO, told The Atlantic. The company has a shorter working week. Parents with children find themselves less stressed out – with more time to spend with their families, leading to a more balanced life. Caretakers of elderly parents also have an opportunity to help their loved ones. “One of the biggest factors in people’s level of work-family satisfaction is the pure number of work hours they have,” Melissa Milkie, a sociologist at the University of Toronto who studies time use, told The Atlantic. “So cutting it is huge … It would re-balance things for working families.”",

However, the American Heart Association suggests that women consume no more than 100 calories (about 6 teaspoons or 24 grams) and men no more than 150 calories (about 9 teaspoons or 36 grams) of added sugar per day. That is close to the amount in a 12-ounce can of soda.",

Sometimes though, the influence of your friends and peers can be a cause of stress. If you feel like you’re being pressured by friends or peers into doing something that you don’t want to do, this is called peer pressure. For example, you might feel pressured to take drugs or drink alcohol, to take dangerous risks when driving, or to have sex before you feel ready. If you are in a situation like this, it’s important to say how you feel and that you don’t want to take part. If your friends keep trying to get you to take part, speak to a trusted adult about how you are feeling. You need to make sure you are safe, so if you do feel at risk, you should reach out to professional services.",

If you accept that other people have a right to be different from you, then you open yourself up to the possibility of experiencing relationships that bring a fresh perspective to your life. Don't expect instant results - good friends aren't made overnight. Sharing your deepest secrets in one night won't necessarily create a close friendship. It may even drive the other person away. Take it slowly. Divulge 'safe' secrets first, and allow the relationship to hold some weight before you share the meatier issues in your life. Don't compromise yourself - each one of us has standards of morality and behaviour. Don't allow yourself to compromise yourself for the sake of 'fitting in' with a group. Many people make friends at work. Open yourself up to the possibilities by participating in social occasions, such as Friday night drinks or lunches to celebrate employee birthdays. Follow your interests. For example, if you like walking, join a neighbourhood walking group. If you don't work and have no particular hobbies, consider joining a volunteer group with a charity that interests you. Use your existing network of family and friends to meet new people. Don't turn down party invitations."

I only want you to respond with the terminal output contained within a single, distinct code block. Don't write justifications. You must wait until I tell you to type commands.

To do this, copy and paste the text in question and then ask it to extract the kind of data you want and in which format. You may, for example, want it to dump the data as a JSON object, etc. It can help find security holes and produce a proof-of-concept. You may also use ChatGPT to determine if a code has security flaws. It will clearly and simply explain to you the reasoning behind the ruling.

The goal is early detection and lifestyle changes or surveillance, to reduce the risk of disease, or to detect it early enough to treat it most effectively. Screening tests are not considered diagnostic, but are used to identify a subset of the population who should have additional testing to determine the presence or absence of disease. What makes a screening test valuable is its ability to detect potential problems, while minimizing unclear, ambiguous, or confusing results. While screening tests are not 100% accurate in all cases, it is generally more valuable to have the screening tests at the appropriate times, as recommended by your healthcare provider, than to not have them at all. However, some screening tests, when used in people not at high risk for disease, or when testing for very rare diseases, can cause more problems than they help. (Hopkins Medicine).

Clutter can come in many forms, and it can be hard to decipher what is and is not clutter. Take time to sort through it all and determine what stays and what goes. By decluttering your living spaces, you can decrease housework, too, by 40%. Staying organized will actually lower your cortisol levels—the body’s primary stress hormone. When you prioritize organization, you give yourself time to focus on what really matters, like your much-needed sleep. Organizing your daily schedule and tasks allows you to concentrate on what needs to get done that day instead of being distracted by things around you. At nighttime, you are able to prioritize sleep and rest easy knowing it’s done.
